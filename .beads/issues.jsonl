Introduces a Go backend service for market data alongside the existing Python/FastAPI backend, with TimescaleDB for time-series price storage. The SvelteKit UI will serve from both backends during the transition period, with an eventual full Go API migration planned.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n- **Go service** handles price data ingestion, technical analysis, and market data API\n- **TimescaleDB** (PostgreSQL extension) stores multi-resolution price data in hypertables\n- **Existing Python backend** continues to serve SEC filing/company data\n- **SvelteKit UI** communicates with both backends via Caddy reverse proxy\n- **Paper trading** for users to simulate trades against real market data\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. Go poller fetches real-time quotes from market data provider (e.g. Polygon, Alpha Vantage)\n2. Raw observations stored in TimescaleDB hypertable with short retention\n3. Aggregated into 5m/1h/24h buckets with progressively longer retention\n4. Signal engine computes technical indicators (MACD, RSI, moving averages)\n5. Go API serves price/chart/signal data to SvelteKit frontend\n6. UI renders charts via LayerChart (D3-based, already used in osrs-flips)\n\n## Phases\n\n1. **Foundation** - TimescaleDB schema, Go service scaffold, Caddy routing\n2. **Data Pipeline** - Market data ingestion, multi-resolution aggregation, API endpoints\n3. **Technical Analysis** - Signal engine (MACD, RSI, crossovers), indicator storage\n4. **UI: Charts \u0026 Signals** - Price charts on company pages, indicator overlays, signal display\n5. **Paper Trading** - Trade execution, portfolio management, P\u0026L tracking\n6. **API Migration** - Gradual migration of Python API endpoints to Go\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\nosrs-flips (~/osrs-flips) serves as the reference architecture:\n- pkg/collector/ - Poller, background sync, signal computation patterns\n- pkg/storage/ - TimescaleDB query patterns, hypertable management\n- ui/src/lib/components/charts/ - LayerChart integration patterns\n- ui/src/lib/stores/trade-store.svelte.ts - Paper trading state management\n- migrations/ - TimescaleDB schema with retention policies and compression","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"steven@fitz.gg","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:32:14.464602147Z","created_by":"Steven Fitzpatrick","updated_at":"2026-02-12T05:19:21.582159452Z"}

{"id":"symbology-zji","title":"Go API Migration Strategy","description":"Plan and begin the gradual migration of the Python FastAPI backend to Go.\n\n## Context\nOnce the Go market data service is stable, evaluate migrating existing Python API endpoints to Go. The EDGAR ingestion pipeline and LLM content generation will remain in Python.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Evaluation Criteria\n- Performance benchmarks: Go vs Python for read-heavy API endpoints\n- Developer experience: maintaining two codebases vs consolidating\n- Migration risk: downtime, data consistency, client compatibility\n\n### Migration Candidates (read-heavy, no LLM dependency)\n1. /companies - Company search, lookup, pagination\n2. /filings - Filing metadata, timelines\n3. /financials - Financial data queries (already time-series-like)\n4. /search - Full-text search (PostgreSQL FTS works from either language)\n5. /documents - Document metadata (not the LLM-generated content)\n\n### Keep in Python\n- /generated-content - Tightly coupled to Anthropic LLM pipeline\n- /prompts - Prompt template management\n- /pipeline - Pipeline orchestration (uses Python worker framework)\n- /jobs - Background job management\n- CLI tools (symbology.cli) - EDGAR ingestion, pipeline triggers\n\n### Migration Approach\n- Implement Go equivalents behind feature flags\n- Caddy can route traffic gradually (canary/blue-green)\n- Ensure API response compatibility (same JSON schema)\n- Run both in parallel, compare responses for validation\n- Cut over endpoint by endpoint\n\n### Shared Database Considerations\n- Both services read from same PostgreSQL tables\n- Need to coordinate schema migrations (who owns what)\n- Consider read replicas if load becomes a concern\n\n## This is a P3 planning task — no implementation until market data service is proven","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"steven@fitz.gg","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:33:56.194432456Z","created_by":"Steven Fitzpatrick","updated_at":"2026-02-11T22:33:56.194432456Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"symbology-zji","depends_on_id":"symbology-5p5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:34:34.517293297Z","created_by":"Steven Fitzpatrick"},{"issue_id":"symbology-zji","depends_on_id":"symbology-2g4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:34:34.551463809Z","created_by":"Steven Fitzpatrick"},{"issue_id":"symbology-zji","depends_on_id":"symbology-087","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:34:34.590782938Z","created_by":"Steven Fitzpatrick"},{"issue_id":"symbology-zji","depends_on_id":"symbology-5d6","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-12T08:14:26.159320524Z","created_by":"Steven Fitzpatrick"}]}
