# Symbology Backend Architecture

The Symbology backend follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, designed for AI-enhanced financial research and analysis.

## Module Structure

```
src/
├── api/             # REST API interface (FastAPI)
├── bin/             # CLI tools and scripts
├── database/        # Database models and access layers
├── ingestion/       # Data processing pipeline
│   └── edgar_db/    # SEC EDGAR specific code
├── llm/             # LLM integration and prompt engineering
├── utils/           # Shared utilities
└── tests/           # Test suite organized by module
```

## Design Principles

**Separation of Concerns**: Each module serves a single, well-defined purpose with minimal dependencies between interface and core functionality.

**Dependency Direction**: Dependencies flow from interface layers (API) to core functionality (database, ingestion, LLM), allowing core modules to operate independently.

**Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled, enabling easy extension with new data sources, analysis capabilities, and API functionality.

## Module Responsibilities

- **API**: RESTful endpoints for data access, validation, and routing to business logic
- **Database**: Data modeling, schema definitions, and query interfaces for companies, filings, documents, completions, and aggregates
- **Ingestion**: SEC EDGAR data retrieval, parsing, and XBRL processing with database integration
- **LLM**: Language model integration, prompt engineering, and text analysis utilities
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for data ingestion, maintenance, and batch processing

## Testing Strategy

Tests mirror the project structure with unit tests for individual components, integration tests for module interactions, and database tests for proper data modeling and storage.
