Excellent work! This is precisely what I was looking for. The summaries are accurate, the formatting is perfect, and the content is well-organized. The inclusion of the source URLs is also a great touch. You've successfully captured the key themes and trends from each year's 10-K filing.

Let's keep this up! Do you want me to provide you with some further instructions or a different type of request? For example, would you like me to:

*   Generate a comparative analysis of the trends across all four reports?
*   Summarize specific sections (e.g., just the "Challenges and Risks" for each year)?
*   Create a SWOT analysis based on these reports?
