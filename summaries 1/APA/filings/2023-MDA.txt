ITEM 7.        MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     
The following discussion relates to APA Corporation (APA or the Company) and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be read together in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated by reference to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of Apache Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (filed with the SEC on February 23, 2023).
On March 1, 2021, Apache Corporation consummated a holding company reorganization (the Holding Company Reorganization), pursuant to which Apache Corporation became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation, and all of Apache Corporation’s outstanding shares automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of APA Corporation. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, APA Corporation became the successor issuer to Apache Corporation pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act and replaced Apache Corporation as the public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “APA.” The Holding Company Reorganization modernized the Company’s operating and legal structure to more closely align with its growing international presence, making it more consistent with other companies that have subsidiaries operating around the globe. As a holding company, APA Corporation’s primary assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries.
Overview
APA is an independent energy company that owns consolidated subsidiaries that explore for, develop, and produce natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The Company’s upstream business has oil and gas operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). APA also has active exploration and appraisal operations ongoing in Suriname, as well as interests in Uruguay and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Prior to the BCP Business Combination (as defined in the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), the Company’s midstream business was operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus).
APA believes energy underpins global progress, and the Company wants to be a part of the solution as society works to meet growing global demand for reliable and affordable energy. APA strives to meet those challenges while creating value for all its stakeholders.
Uncertainties in the global supply chain and financial markets, including the impact of inflation and rising interest rates, and actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including OPEC+, continue to impact oil supply and demand and contribute to commodity price volatility. Despite these uncertainties, the Company remains committed to its longer-term objectives: (1) to invest for long-term returns in pursuit of moderate, sustainable production growth; (2) to strengthen the balance sheet to underpin the generation of cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration, appraisal, and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction, share repurchases, and other return of capital to its shareholders; and (3) to responsibly manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment. 
The Company closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals to reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process. APA’s diversified asset portfolio and operational flexibility provide it the ability to timely respond to near-term price volatility and effectively manage its investment programs accordingly. For example, the Company deferred drilling and completion activity at Alpine High in the second quarter of 2023 in response to weakness in Waha natural gas and NGL prices but accelerated the completion of eight Permian Basin oil producing wells. The Company also suspended drilling activity in the North Sea during the second quarter of 2023, as increasing cost and tax burdens have impacted the competitiveness of these assets within the Company’s portfolio. Capital investment plans were then aligned across other areas of the portfolio while maintaining a focus on the Company’s capital returns framework established in 2021.
The Company remains committed to its capital return framework for equity holders to participate more directly and materially in cash returns.
•The Company believes returning 60 percent of cash flow over capital investment creates a good balance for providing near-term cash returns to shareholders while still recognizing the importance of longer-term balance sheet strengthening.
•The Company’s quarterly dividend was increased in the third quarter of 2022 from $0.125 per share to $0.25 per share, representing a return to pre-COVID-19 dividend levels. 
•Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and through the end of 2023, the Company has repurchased 76.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to year-end 2023 and through the date of this filing on February 22, 2024, the Company repurchased 3.0 million shares, and as of February 22, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 40.9 million shares under the Company’s share repurchase programs. 
Financial and Operational Highlights
During 2023, the Company reported net income attributable to common stock of $2.9 billion, or $9.25 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.7 billion, or $11.02 per diluted share, in 2022. Net income in 2023 was primarily impacted by lower revenues attributable to significantly lower realized commodity prices compared to 2022. The lower revenues were partially offset by a release of a majority of the Company’s U.S. tax valuation allowance, resulting in a non-cash deferred income tax benefit of approximately $1.7 billion during the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income in 2022 also benefited from approximately $1.2 billion of gains from the divestiture of certain non-core mineral rights in the Delaware Basin and completion of the BCP Business Combination.
The Company generated $3.1 billion of cash from operating activities in 2023, which was $1.8 billion or 37 percent lower than 2022. APA’s lower operating cash flows for 2023 were driven by lower commodity prices and associated revenues and the timing of working capital items. The Company repurchased 8.7 million shares of its common stock for $329 million and paid $308 million in dividends to APA common stockholders during 2023.
Key operational highlights for the year include:
United States
•Daily boe production from the Company’s U.S. assets, which increased 2 percent from 2022, accounted for 54 percent of the Company’s worldwide production during 2023. The Company averaged five drilling rigs in the U.S. during the year, including three rigs in the Southern Midland Basin and two rigs in the Delaware Basin, and drilled and brought online 82 operated wells in 2023. The Company’s drilling was primarily focused on oil prospects, increasing oil production by approximately 12 percent in the U.S. compared to the prior year. The Company’s core Permian Basin development program continues to represent key growth areas for the U.S. assets. 
•During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company commenced an exploration program in Alaska, where it anticipates drilling three exploration wells in the first half of 2024.
International
•In Egypt, the Company continued its drilling and workover activity with a focus on oil prospects. The Company averaged 17 drilling rigs and drilled 91 new productive wells during 2023. During 2023, gross and net production from the Company’s Egypt assets decreased 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, from 2022. The Company continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory in Egypt, supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage opportunities provided by the 2021 merged concession agreement.
•The Company suspended all new drilling activity in the North Sea during the second quarter of 2023. The Company’s investment program in the North Sea is now directed toward safety, base production management, and asset maintenance and integrity.
•During 2023, the Company and TotalEnergies announced the launch of development studies for a large oil project in Block 58, offshore Suriname. Successful appraisal of two key oil discoveries, with the drilling and testing of two wells at Sapakara South and three wells at Krabdagu, confirmed combined recoverable resources of an estimated 700 million barrels of oil for the two fields. These fields, located in water depths between 100 and 1,000 meters, are expected to be produced through a system of subsea wells connected to a floating production, storage and offloading unit located 150 kilometers off the Suriname coast, with an oil production capacity of 200,000 b/d. Detailed engineering studies are underway, and a final investment decision is expected by year-end 2024, with a first production target in 2028. No additional drilling is anticipated on Block 58 through the end of 2024.
•During 2023, the Company signed a production sharing contract for Block 6 offshore Uruguay covering approximately four million net undeveloped acres and expects to commence exploration activities in 2024. In February 2024, the Company also signed a production sharing contract for Block 4 offshore Uruguay.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity
Over the Company’s history, it has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize APA’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, the Company has completed a series of acquisitions and divestitures designed to enhance the Company’s portfolio and monetize nonstrategic assets in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These acquisitions and divestitures include:
•Callon Petroleum Company Pending Acquisition On January 3, 2024, APA and Callon Petroleum Company (Callon) entered into a definitive agreement (Merger Agreement), pursuant to which APA will acquire Callon in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion, inclusive of Callon’s net debt.
In this all-stock transaction, each eligible outstanding share of Callon common stock will be exchanged for 1.0425 shares of APA common stock, representing an implied value to each Callon share of $38.31 per share based on the closing price of APA common stock on January 3, 2024. After closing, existing APA shareholders are expected to own approximately 81 percent of the combined company, and existing Callon shareholders are expected to own approximately 19 percent of the combined company. APA expects to retire the existing debt at Callon and replace it with APA term loan facilities totaling $2.0 billion.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both APA and Callon and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, termination or expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval of the transaction by shareholders of both APA and Callon. This transaction complements and enhances APA’s asset base in the Permian Basin and adds to APA’s inventory of high quality, short-cycle opportunities. In addition, Callon’s assets provide additional scale to APA’s operations across the Permian Basin.
•BCP Business Combination On February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP) in an all-stock transaction. Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. (Kinetik). The Company deconsolidated ALTM upon closing the transaction. The deconsolidation provides a number of benefits to APA shareholders, including simplification of the Company’s financial reporting and enhanced comparability with its upstream-only peers, while maintaining a noncontrolling interest in future growth opportunities of Kinetik.
•Delaware Basin Acquisition In the third quarter of 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of oil and gas assets surrounding core acreage in the Delaware Basin for approximately $615 million after post-closing adjustments. Final cash settlements of $24 million were completed during 2023.
•Sales of Kinetik Shares Subsequent sales of Kinetik Shares have reduced APA’s ownership in Kinetik to approximately 9 percent as of December 31, 2023. During 2023, the Company sold a portion of its Kinetik Shares for cash proceeds of $228 million. During 2022, the Company sold a portion of its Kinetik Shares for $224 million.

Average realized crude oil prices for 2023 were down 19 percent compared to 2022, a direct result of decreasing benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in 2023 averaged $80.72 per barrel.
Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of the Company’s asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Prices for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.
Natural Gas Prices Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The Company’s primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in the Company’s primary gas-producing regions follows:
•The Company sells its U.S. natural gas production at liquid index sales points within the U.S., at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The Company’s U.S. realizations averaged $1.80 per Mcf in 2023, a 66 percent decrease from an average of $5.31 per Mcf in 2022.
•In Egypt, the Company’s natural gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the Company’s Egypt operations averaged $2.91 per Mcf in 2023, a 2 percent increase from an average of $2.85 per Mcf in 2022.
•Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The Company’s North Sea operations averaged $13.02 per Mcf in 2023, a 44 percent decrease from an average of $23.36 per Mcf in 2022.
NGL Prices The Company’s U.S. NGL production, which accounted for 98 percent of the Company’s total 2023 NGL production, is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
Crude Oil Revenues 
Crude oil revenues for 2023 totaled $6.0 billion, an $838 million decrease from the 2022 total of $6.8 billion. A 19 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2023 revenues by $1.3 billion compared to 2022, while 8 percent higher average daily production increased revenues by $430 million. Average daily production in 2023 was 203 Mb/d, with prices averaging $80.72 per barrel. Crude oil sales accounted for 81 percent of the Company’s 2023 oil and gas production revenues and 50 percent of its worldwide production.
The Company’s worldwide crude oil production increased 15 Mb/d compared to 2022, primarily a result of increased drilling activity in the U.S. and Egypt, and less maintenance downtime in the North Sea, partially offset by natural production decline across all assets.
Natural Gas Revenues
Natural gas revenues for 2023 totaled $880 million, a $689 million decrease from the 2022 total of $1.6 billion. A 42 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2023 revenues by $652 million compared to 2022, while 4 percent lower average daily production decreased revenues by $37 million. Average daily production in 2023 was 828 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $2.91 per Mcf. Natural gas sales accounted for 12 percent of the Company’s 2023 oil and gas production revenues and 34 percent of its worldwide production.
The Company’s worldwide natural gas production decreased 37 MMcf/d compared to 2022, primarily a result of natural production decline across all assets and the sale of non-core assets in the U.S., partially offset by increased drilling activity and recompletions and less maintenance downtime in the North Sea.
NGL Revenues
NGL revenues for 2023 totaled $508 million, a $308 million decrease from the 2022 total of $816 million. A 38 percent decrease in average realized prices primarily drove the decrease in NGL revenues compared to 2022. Average daily production in 2023 was 64 Mb/d, with prices averaging $21.54 per barrel. NGL sales accounted for 7 percent of the Company’s 2023 oil and gas production revenues and 16 percent of its worldwide production.
The Company’s worldwide NGL production increased slightly compared to 2022, primarily a result of increased drilling activity and recompletions and less maintenance downtime in the North Sea, offset by natural production decline across all assets.
Purchased Oil and Gas Sales
Purchased oil and gas sales represent volumes primarily attributable to domestic gas purchases that were sold by the Company to fulfill natural gas takeaway obligations and delivery commitments. In 2023, in order to diversify the pricing received for the sale of its natural gas, the Company sold a portion of its purchased gas at international gas prices. Sales related to purchased volumes decreased $961 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $894 million from $1.9 billion in 2022. Purchased oil and gas sales were partially offset by associated purchase costs of $742 million and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in purchased oil and gas sales is primarily a result of lower average domestic natural gas prices during 2023 compared to 2022.
Operating Expenses
The table below presents a comparison of the Company’s operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Altus.

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)
LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repairs and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Crude oil, which accounted for 50 percent of the Company’s total 2023 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
During 2023, LOE decreased $8 million, or 1 percent, compared to 2022. On a per-boe basis, LOE decreased $0.27, or 3 percent, compared to 2022, from $9.95 per boe to $9.68 per boe. The decrease in costs was driven by lower average foreign currency exchange impacts against the U.S. dollar and decreased workover activity primarily in the North Sea. These decreases were mostly offset by higher labor costs and other operating costs trending with general inflation across all regions.
Gathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT)
GPT expenses include amounts paid to third-party carriers for gathering and transmission services for the Company’s upstream natural gas production. Prior to the BCP Business Combination and the Company’s deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, GPT expenses also included gathering and transmission services provided by Altus Midstream and midstream operating costs incurred by Altus. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

                                                                                                        For the Year Ended December 31,

Total Gathering, processing, and transmission                     $334                          $367                          $264     
GPT costs decreased $33 million compared to 2022, primarily the result of lower upstream processing and transmission costs, partially offset by impacts of the BCP Business Combination. Upstream processing and transmission costs decreased $46 million from 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in natural gas production volumes when compared to the prior-year period. Costs for services provided by ALTM in 2022 prior to the BCP Business Combination totaling $18 million were eliminated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and reflected as “Intersegment eliminations” in the table above. Subsequent to the Company’s deconsolidation of Altus in February 2022, these midstream services continue to be provided by Kinetik but are no longer eliminated.
Purchased Oil and Gas Costs
Purchased oil and gas costs decreased $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $742 million from $1.8 billion in 2022. The decrease is a result of lower average domestic natural gas prices during 2023 compared to the prior year. Purchased oil and gas costs were more than offset by associated sales to fulfill natural gas takeaway obligations and delivery commitments totaling $894 million for the year ended 2023, as discussed above.
Taxes Other Than Income
Taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on onshore properties and in state waters off the coast of the U.S. and ad valorem taxes on U.S. properties. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. The Company is also subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes.
Taxes other than income decreased $61 million compared to 2022, primarily from lower severance taxes driven by lower commodity prices and lower ad valorem tax rates.
Exploration Expenses
Exploration expenses include unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expenses, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

                                                                                            For the Year Ended December 31,

Exploration expenses decreased $110 million compared to 2022, primarily the result of higher dry hole expense in Suriname during 2022 coupled with lower exploration overhead and other activities in 2023.
General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses
G&A expenses decreased $132 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by lower cash-based stock compensation expense during 2023 resulting from decreases in the Company’s stock price and in the achievement of performance and financial objectives as defined in the stock award plans. For additional information refer to Note 14—Capital Stock in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Transaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS) Costs
TRS costs decreased $11 million compared to 2022. Higher TRS costs in 2022 were incurred in connection with the BCP Business Combination in the first quarter of 2022.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A expenses on the Company’s oil and gas property for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $314 million compared to 2022. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate increased $1.94 per boe in 2023 compared to 2022, from $8.18 per boe to $10.12 per boe, driven by general cost inflation and the unit of production impact of lower proved reserves during 2023. The increase on an absolute basis was also impacted by an increase in capital investment activity in Egypt and acquisitions in the U.S.
Impairments
During 2023, the Company recorded $61 million of impairments, primarily in connection with valuations of drilling and operations equipment inventory upon the Company’s decision to suspend drilling operations in the North Sea. No asset impairments were recorded in 2022. 
Financing Costs, Net 
Financing costs incurred during 2023, 2022, and 2021 comprised the following:

                                                                                               For the Year Ended December 31,

Net financing costs during 2023 decreased $67 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by losses incurred on the extinguishment of debt during 2022 and gains on extinguishment of debt during 2023, partially offset by an increase in interest expense during 2023 related to higher variable interest rates on credit facility borrowings.
Provision for Income Taxes 
Income tax expense decreased $2.0 billion from $1.7 billion during 2022 to an income tax benefit of $324 million during 2023. The Company’s 2023 effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by a deferred tax expense related to the release of a portion of its valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets and the remeasurement of taxes in the U.K. as a result of the enactment of Finance Act 2023 on January 10, 2023. During 2022, the Company’s effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by a deferred tax expense related to the remeasurement of taxes in the U.K. as a result of the enactment of the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act of 2022 (the Energy Profits Levy) on July 14, 2022, and a decrease in the amount of valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
On July 14, 2022, the Energy Profits Levy was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. Under the law, an additional levy was assessed at a 25 percent rate and is effective for the period of May 26, 2022, through December 31, 2025. The Finance Act 2023 included amendments to the Energy Profits Levy that increased the levy from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., the financial statement impact of new legislation is recorded in the period of enactment. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $208 million and $174 million related to the remeasurement of the U.K. deferred tax liability in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA includes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company is not an applicable corporation in 2023 but will be subject to CAMT beginning on January 1, 2024. The Company is continuing to evaluate the provisions of the IRA and its effects on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released Model Rules under the Pillar Two framework, which imposes a 15 percent global minimum tax on large corporations. Such Model Rules have been adopted in certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the United Kingdom, with an effective date of January 1, 2024. While the Company does not anticipate that Pillar Two will have a material impact on its effective tax rate, the Company will continue to evaluate the potential impacts of enacted and pending legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. The Company showed positive income over the three-year period ended December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of increases in projections of future taxable income and the absence of objective negative evidence such as a cumulative loss in recent years, the Company determined there was sufficient positive evidence to release a majority of the U.S. valuation allowance, which resulted in a non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $1.7 billion. The remaining U.S. valuation allowance relates primarily to foreign tax credit and capital loss carryforwards.
For additional information regarding income taxes, refer to Note 10—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority. On September 26, 2022, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the IRS disallowing certain net operating loss carryback and research and development credit refund claims. As a result of the disallowance, on December 14, 2022, the Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court challenging the tax adjustments and requesting a redetermination of the deficiencies stated in the notice. The Company is also under audit in various states and foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business.
Capital and Operational Outlook
The Company continues to prudently manage its capital program against a volatile price environment and the effects of global inflation and rising interest rates. Despite these uncertainties, the Company remains committed to its longer-term objectives: (1) to invest for long-term returns in pursuit of moderate, sustainable production growth; (2) to strengthen the balance sheet to underpin the generation of cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration, appraisal, and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction, share repurchases, and other return of capital to its shareholders; and (3) to responsibly manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment. 
In 2024, the Company plans to invest $1.9 to $2.0 billion in upstream capital investment. This investment level reflects the Company’s strategy of moderating activity levels during periods of lower commodity prices. APA will invest for the long term by directing $100 million of the 2024 upstream budget toward exploration activities predominantly in Alaska and $50 million toward progressing a large-scale floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) project in Suriname. The Company’s worldwide adjusted oil and natural gas production is expected be relatively flat year over year, while NGL volumes are anticipated to be lower as the current strip prices would lead to ethane rejection in the U.S. for most of the year. 
At current strip pricing, the Company expects to generate significant cash flow over this capital activity budget. The Company’s current commitment to return capital to shareholders through a mix of dividends and share buybacks remains unchanged.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company’s short-term and long-term operating cash flows are impacted by highly volatile commodity prices, as well as production costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact the Company’s revenues, earnings, and cash flows. These changes potentially impact the Company’s liquidity if costs do not trend with sustained decreases in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short term.
The Company’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of the Company’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically. Changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a slight downward reserve revision related to decreases in commodity prices during the year. The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 18—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company believes its available liquidity and capital resource alternatives, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including the Company’s capital development program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, share buy-back activity, and amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies. 
The Company may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.

Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by volatile commodity prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, and deferred income tax expense.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $3.1 billion, down $1.8 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily the result of significantly lower commodity prices and associated revenues and timing of working capital items.
For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and operating expenses, refer to “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, refer to the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Proceeds from Asset Divestitures The Company received $29 million and $778 million in proceeds from the divestiture of certain non-core assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures and equity method interests, refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Proceeds from Sale of Kinetik Shares The Company received $228 million and $224 million of cash proceeds from the sales of its Kinetik Shares during 2023 and 2022, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s equity method interests, refer to Note 6—Equity Method Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents
Additions to Upstream Oil & Gas Property  Exploration and development cash expenditures were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is reflective of the Company’s capital program in 2023 and its focus to balance capital investments with cash flow from operations, debt repayment, and capital returns to shareholders. The Company operated an average of 24 drilling rigs during 2023, compared to an average of 22 drilling rigs during 2022. 
Acquisition of Delaware Basin Properties During 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of oil and gas assets in the Delaware Basin for a total purchase price of $615 million after post-closing adjustments. Final cash settlements of $24 million were completed during 2023. Cash consideration paid during 2022 totaled $591 million.
Leasehold and Property Acquisitions During 2023 and 2022, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $20 million and $37 million, respectively.
Payments on Revolving Credit Facilities, Net As of December 31, 2023, outstanding borrowings under the Company’s U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facility were $372 million, a decrease of $194 million from December 31, 2022 as operating cash flows generated in 2023 were used to repay facility borrowings.
Payments on Fixed-Rate Debt During 2023, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $74 million for an aggregate purchase price of $65 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $10 million. The Company recognized a $9 million gain on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by Apache’s borrowing under the Company’s US dollar-denominated revolving credit facility.
During 2022, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes issued under its indentures, accepting for purchase $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Apache paid holders an aggregate $1.2 billion in cash, reflecting principal, premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a $66 million loss on extinguishment of debt, including $11 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs in connection with the note purchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.
During 2022, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $15 million for an aggregate purchase price of $16 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a premium to par of an aggregate $1 million. The Company recognized a $1 million loss on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.
On October 17, 2022, Apache redeemed the outstanding $123 million outstanding principal amount of 2.625% notes due January 15, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption was financed in part by Apache’s borrowing under the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility.
On January 18, 2022, Apache redeemed the outstanding $213 million principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due April 15, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption was financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.
The Company expects that Apache will continue to reduce debt outstanding under its indentures from time to time.
Dividends Paid to APA Common Stockholders The Company paid $308 million and $207 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for dividends on its common stock. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend from $0.125 per share to $0.25 per share.
Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest - Egypt Sinopec holds a one-third minority participation interest in the Company’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Company paid $238 million and $362 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in cash distributions to Sinopec.
Treasury Stock Activity, Net During 2023, the Company repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $37.81 per share totaling $329 million, and as of December 31, 2023, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase 43.9 million shares. During 2022, the Company repurchased 36.2 million shares at an average price of $39.34 per share totaling $1.4 billion.

Available committed borrowing capacity under syndicated credit facilities                   2,894                     2,238    
Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $87 million in cash and cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Debt As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $5.2 billion in total debt outstanding, which consisted of notes and debentures of Apache, credit facility borrowings, and finance lease obligations. As of December 31, 2023, current debt included $2 million of finance lease obligations.
Committed 2022 Credit Facilities On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into two unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes that replaced and refinanced Apache’s 2018 unsecured syndicated credit agreement (the Former Facility). 
•One agreement is denominated in US dollars (the USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of US$1.8 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$750 million, of which US$150 million currently is committed). The Company may increase commitments up to an aggregate US$2.3 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. This facility matures in April 2027, subject to the Company’s two, one-year extension options. 
•The second agreement is denominated in pounds sterling (the GBP Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £1.5 billion for loans and letters of credit. This facility matures in April 2027, subject to the Company’s two, one-year extension options.
In connection with the Company’s entry into the USD Agreement and the GBP Agreement (each, a 2022 Agreement), Apache terminated US$4.0 billion of commitments under the Former Facility, borrowings then outstanding under the Former Facility were deemed outstanding under the USD Agreement, and letters of credit then outstanding under the Former Facility were deemed outstanding under a 2022 Agreement, depending upon whether denominated in US dollars or pounds sterling. Apache may borrow under the USD Agreement up to an aggregate principal amount of US$300 million outstanding at any given time. Apache has guaranteed obligations under each 2022 Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than US$1.0 billion.
As of December 31, 2023, there were $372 million of borrowings under the USD Agreement and an aggregate £348 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, there were $566 million of borrowings and a $20 million letter of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement, and an aggregate £652 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. The letters of credit denominated in pounds were issued to support North Sea decommissioning obligations, the terms of which require such support while Apache’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s remains below BBB; on March 26, 2020, Standard & Poor’s reduced Apache’s rating from BBB to BB+, which was affirmed in 2023.
All borrowings under the USD Agreement bear interest at one of two per annum rate options selected by the borrower, being either an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.675% (Base Rate Margin), or an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 1.10% to 1.675% (Applicable Margin). All borrowings under the GBP Agreement bear interest at an adjusted rate per annum determined by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index Average published by the Bank of England, plus the Applicable Margin. Each 2022 Agreement also requires the borrower to pay quarterly a facility fee on total commitments. Margins and facility fees are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). As of December 31, 2023, Apache’s Long-Term Debt Rating applied, and the Base Rate Margin was 0.40%, the Applicable Margin was 1.40%, and the facility fee was 0.225%.
A commission is payable quarterly to lenders under each 2022 Agreement on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect. Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.
Borrowers under each 2022 Agreement, which may include certain subsidiaries of APA, may borrow, prepay, and reborrow loans and obtain letters of credit, and APA may obtain letters of credit for the account of its subsidiaries, in each case subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default substantially similar to those in the Former Facility, such as:
•A financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital continues to exclude the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2023, APA’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under each 2022 Agreement was 20 percent.
•A negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U. S. and Canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets or approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2023.
•Negative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
•Lenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if a borrower or certain subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of a borrower or certain subsidiaries.
Consistent with the Former Facility, the 2022 Agreements do not require collateral, do not have a borrowing base, do not permit lenders to accelerate maturity or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes, and do not have borrowing restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of each 2022 Agreement as of December 31, 2023.
There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future credit facilities will make loans or other extensions of credit available to APA or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders.
There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to APA or its subsidiaries will not deteriorate. The Company closely monitors the ratings of the banks in its bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.
Uncommitted Credit Facilities Each of the Company and Apache from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2023, there were £416 million and $2 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2022, there were £199 million and $17 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities.
Commercial Paper Program On December 13, 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program under which it from time to time may issue in private placements exempt from registration under the Securities Act short-term unsecured promissory notes (the CP Notes) up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $1.8 billion outstanding at any time. The Company intends to use net proceeds of the CP Notes for general corporate purposes.
Payment of the CP Notes has been unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Apache, such guarantee effective until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than US$1.0 billion.
The CP Notes will be sold under customary market terms in the U.S. commercial paper market at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance. The maturities of the CP Notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not issued any CP Notes.
Committed Delayed-Draw Term Loan Facility. On January 30, 2024, APA entered into a syndicated credit agreement under which the lenders have committed an aggregate $2.0 billion for senior unsecured delayed-draw term loans to APA (Credit Agreement). Subject to satisfaction of certain limited conditions, APA may borrow under the Credit Agreement to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon Petroleum Company, a Delaware corporation (Callon), upon or after closing of APA’s pending acquisition of Callon pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger among APA, Astro Comet Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of APA, and Callon, dated January 3, 2024 (Merger Agreement).
Two tranches of term loans would be available to APA for borrowing only on the date of closing of transactions under the Merger Agreement and satisfaction of certain other conditions under the Credit Agreement (Closing Date); of the aggregate $2.0 billion in commitments, $1.5 billion is for term loans that would mature three years after the Closing Date (3-Year Tranche Loans) and $500 million is for term loans that would mature 364 days after the Closing Date (364-Day Tranche Loans).
Indebtedness of Callon that APA could refinance by borrowing under the Credit Agreement on the Closing Date includes indebtedness outstanding under (i) the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 19, 2022, among Callon, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (Callon Credit Agreement), (ii) Callon’s 6.375% Senior Notes due 2026 (Callon’s 2026 Notes), (iii) Callon’s 8.00% Senior Notes due 2028 (Callon’s 2028 Notes), and (iv) Callon’s 7.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (Callon’s 2030 Notes, and together with the Callon Credit Agreement, Callon’s 2026 Notes, and Callon’s 2028 Notes, the Callon Indebtedness).
The Credit Agreement has limited conditions to funding on the Closing Date loans requested by APA in accordance with the Credit Agreement, such as consummation of the transactions under the Merger Agreement, no Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has occurred, repayment of all indebtedness outstanding under the Callon Credit Agreement and Callon’s 2026 Notes, and Callon having no other material indebtedness for borrowed money except for Callon’s 2028 Notes and Callon’s 2030 Notes or as permitted under the Credit Agreement or the Merger Agreement.
Proceeds of loans made under the Credit Agreement may only be used to refinance the Callon Indebtedness and repay fees and expenses related to transactions under the Credit Agreement and the Merger Agreement. To the extent that borrowings by APA under the Credit Agreement are not so used on or before the date that is 120 days after the Closing Date, APA then must prepay the amount of such unused borrowings.
Apache has guaranteed obligations under the Credit Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than $1.0 billion.
If $400 million or more in aggregate principal amount of Callon’s 2028 Notes and Callon’s 2030 Notes remains outstanding on the date which is 120 days after the Closing Date, Callon then must guarantee APA’s obligations under the Credit Agreement effective until the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Callon’s 2028 Notes and Callon’s 2030 Notes first is less than $400 million.
APA may at any time prepay loans under the Credit Agreement. APA may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the lenders’ commitments under the Credit Agreement. Unless previously terminated, the lenders’ commitments automatically terminate on the first to occur of: (i) the Closing Date, after giving effect to funding of each lender’s commitments on the Closing Date, (ii) APA’s acquisition of Callon pursuant to the Merger Agreement without loans being 
made under the Credit Agreement, (iii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iv) the Termination Date (as defined in, and may be extended pursuant to, the Merger Agreement).
All borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be in U.S. Dollars and bear interest at one of the following two rate options, as selected by APA, plus the indicated margin:
•One option is a base rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the applicable prime rate, (ii) the greater of the applicable federal funds rate and overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.50%, and (iii) an adjusted secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (SOFR) for a one-month interest period plus 1.0%. The margin for this rate option (Term Base Rate Margin) is a rate per annum varying from 0.25% to 1.0% for 364-Day Tranche Loans, 0.375% to 1.125% for 3-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 0.625% to 1.375% for 3-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, in each case, based on the rating for senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache. Apache’s Long-Term Debt Rating currently applies. 
•The second option is an adjusted SOFR rate, plus a margin at a rate per annum varying from 1.25% to 2.0% for 364-Day Tranche Loans, 1.375% to 2.125% for 3-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 1.625% to 2.375% for 3-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, in each case, based on the Long-Term Debt Rating (Term Applicable Margin). For SOFR-based interest rates, APA may select an interest period of one, three, or six months.
Currently, the Term Base Rate Margin is 0.625% for 364-Day Tranche Loans and 0.75% for 3-Year Tranche Loans, and the Term Applicable Margin is 1.625% for 364-Day Tranche Loans and 1.75% for 3-Year Tranche Loans.
The Credit Agreement provides for a ticking fee payable by APA at a rate of 0.225% per annum on the daily average undrawn aggregate commitments thereunder; the ticking fee accrues during the period beginning on the date that is 90 days after January 3, 2024 to the earlier of (i) termination or expiration of the commitments or (ii) the Closing Date.
APA is subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default under the Credit Agreement substantially similar to those in APA’s existing 2022 Agreements. The Credit Agreement does not permit lenders to accelerate maturity based on unspecified material adverse changes and does not have prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
Contractual Obligations
Purchase Obligations From time to time, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had contractual obligations totaling $1.7 billion, of which $956 million is related to U.S. firm transportation contracts, $614 million is related to the merged concession agreement with the EGPC, and $135 million is related to other items. Under terms agreed to in the Egypt modernized PSC, the Company committed to spend a minimum of $3.5 billion on exploration, development, and operating activities by March 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has spent $2.9 billion and believes it will be able to satisfy the remaining obligation within its current exploration and development program. 
Leases In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842 (Leases). As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net undiscounted minimum commitments of $346 million and $41 million for operating and finance leases, respectively. 
Interest Expense Future interest payments based on the current maturity dates of the Company’s fixed-rate notes and debentures as of December 31, 2023 are approximately $3.9 billion. 
For additional information regarding these obligations, refer to Note 9—Debt and Financing Costs and Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For information regarding the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Notes 8—Asset Retirement Obligation and Note 12—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. The Company’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $5 million for environmental remediation and approximately $83 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies and other commitments, please see Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM’s website as “rescinded,” if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that the Company provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Company’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. Additionally, the Company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which the Company has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom the Company has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties
The Company’s subsidiaries have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. The Company has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of such GOM assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, APA’s subsidiaries could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, such subsidiaries may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
In 2013, Apache sold its GOM Shelf operations and properties and its GOM operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $3.75 billion and Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOM Assets). In respect of such abandonment obligations, Fieldwood posted letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit) and established trust accounts (Trust A and Trust B) of which Apache was a beneficiary and which were funded by two net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the 2018 bankruptcy, Fieldwood confirmed a plan under which Apache agreed, inter alia, to (i) accept bonds in exchange for certain of the Letters of Credit and (ii) amend the Trust A trust agreement and one of the NPIs to consolidate the trusts into a single Trust (Trust A) funded by both remaining NPIs. Following the 2018 reorganization of Fieldwood, Apache held two bonds (Bonds) and five Letters of Credit securing Fieldwood’s asset retirement obligations on the Legacy GOM Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for decommissioning any Legacy GOM Asset over the remaining life of the Legacy GOM Assets.
On August 3, 2020, Fieldwood again filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 25, 2021, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) entered an order confirming Fieldwood’s bankruptcy plan. On August 27, 2021, Fieldwood’s bankruptcy plan became effective. Pursuant to the plan, the Legacy GOM Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf’s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOM Assets will be used to fund the operation of GOM Shelf and the decommissioning of Legacy GOM Assets. 
By letter dated April 5, 2022, replacing two prior letters dated September 8, 2021 and February 22, 2022, and by subsequent letter dated March 1, 2023, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it is currently obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOM Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE to decommission certain of the Legacy GOM Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notifications to BSEE. Apache expects to receive similar orders on the other Legacy GOM Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Apache has also received orders to decommission other Legacy GOM Assets that were not included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOM Assets.
As of December 31, 2023, Apache has incurred $819 million in decommissioning costs related to Legacy GOM Assets. GOM Shelf did not, and has confirmed that it will not, reimburse Apache for these decommissioning costs. As a result, Apache has sought and will continue to seek reimbursement from its security for these costs. As of December 31, 2023, $293 million has been reimbursed from Trust A and $336 million has been reimbursed from the Letters of Credit. If GOM Shelf does not reimburse Apache for further decommissioning costs incurred with respect to Legacy GOM Assets, then Apache will continue to seek reimbursement from Trust A, to the extent of available funds, and thereafter, will seek reimbursement from the Bonds and the Letters of Credit until all such funds and securities are fully utilized. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache has agreed to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $400 million to perform decommissioning (Standby Loan Agreement), with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOM Assets. 
If the combination of GOM Shelf’s net cash flow from its producing properties, the Trust A funds, the Bonds, and the remaining Letters of Credit are insufficient to fully fund decommissioning of any Legacy GOM Assets that Apache may be required to perform or fund, or if GOM Shelf’s net cash flow from its remaining producing properties after the Trust A funds, Bonds, and Letters of Credit are exhausted is insufficient to repay any loans made by Apache under the Standby Loan Agreement, then Apache may be forced to use its available cash to fund the deficit.
As of December 31, 2023, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund the remaining decommissioning of Legacy GOM Assets it may be ordered to perform or fund ranges from $824 million to $1.2 billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a contingent liability of $824 million as of December 31, 2023, representing the estimated costs of decommissioning it may be required to perform or fund on Legacy GOM Assets. Of the total liability recorded, $764 million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of Mexico properties,” and $60 million is reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache’s estimated liability, including expected decommissioning rig spread rates, lift boat rates, and planned abandonment logistics could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.
As of December 31, 2023, the Company has also recorded a $199 million asset, which represents the remaining amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from the Trust A funds, the Bonds, and the Letters of Credit for decommissioning it may be required to perform on Legacy GOM Assets. Of the total asset recorded, $21 million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning security for sold Gulf of Mexico properties,” and $178 million is reflected under “Other current assets.” 
The Company recognized $212 million, $157 million, and $446 million during 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, of “Losses on previously sold Gulf of Mexico properties” to reflect the net impact of changes to the estimated decommissioning liability and decommissioning asset to the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.
On June 21, 2023, the two sureties that issued bonds directly to Apache and two sureties that issued bonds to the issuing bank on the Letters of Credit filed suit against Apache in a case styled Zurich American Insurance Company, HCC International Insurance Company PLC, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company and Everest Reinsurance Company (Insurers) v. Apache Corporation, Cause No. 2023-38238 in the 281st Judicial District Court, Harris County Texas. Insurers are seeking to prevent Apache from drawing on the Bonds and Letters of Credit and further allege that they are discharged from their reimbursement obligations related to decommissioning costs and are entitled to other relief. On July 20, 2023, the 281st Judicial District Court denied the Insurers’ request for a temporary injunction. On July 26, 2023, Apache removed the suit to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) which subsequently held that the sureties’ state court lawsuit violated the terms of the Bankruptcy Confirmation Order and is void. Apache has drawn down the entirety of the Letters of Credit and is vigorously pursuing its claims against the sureties.
Insurance Program
The Company maintains insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to its assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. The Company’s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that it must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, the Company’s insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect the Company against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Further, the Company does not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including Gulf of Mexico named windstorm and business interruption. Service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify the Company for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider. 
The Company purchases multi-year political risk insurance from The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit Trade (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $500 million.
Apache also has an insurance policy with U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $150 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting its share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $60 million in reinsurance to DFC.
Future insurance coverage for the Company’s industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company identifies certain accounting policies involving estimation as critical accounting estimates based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting estimates address accounting matters that are inherently uncertain due to unknown future resolution of such matters. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each critical accounting estimate. The following is a discussion of the Company’s most critical accounting estimates.
Reserves Estimates
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
Despite judgment involved in these engineering estimates, the Company’s reserves are used throughout its financial statements. For example, since the Company uses the units-of-production method to amortize its oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for the Company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. For more information regarding the Company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures, refer to Note 18—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous twelve months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
The Company has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
Oil and Gas Exploration Costs
The Company accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
Offshore Decommissioning Contingency
The Company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. For information regarding estimated potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties, please refer to “Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties” above and in Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company’s estimated contingent obligation is primarily associated with the abandonment, removal and decommissioning of offshore wells and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Estimating any future obligation requires significant judgment. The Company utilizes actual abandonment and decommissioning costs incurred as the basis to estimate the expected cash outflows for future obligations. Actual costs incurred often vary based on each structure’s condition, depth-of-water, type, and other similar factors, which are key considerations when estimating the remaining well and platform decommissioning obligation. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, and safety considerations. Changes in significant assumptions or the regulatory framework impacting the Company’s estimated liability could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.
Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)
The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Company’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
Income Taxes
The Company’s oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements and tax returns. Management routinely assesses the ability to realize the Company’s deferred tax assets. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
