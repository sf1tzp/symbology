ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Market Conditions
We are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our two business segments: OFSE and IET. We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments, as well as broader industrial and new energy markets.
During 2024, Baker Hughes continued to deliver significant improvement across the company and in our financial results over 2023. We capitalized on market tailwinds to deliver substantial IET revenue growth, navigated an uneven market to deliver modest OFSE revenue growth, and realized widening benefits from our transformation efforts across the company. We also maintained strong order momentum in IET, led by significant growth in new energy and non-LNG equipment orders.
As we look to 2025, we see a muted outlook for global upstream spending due to recent oil price volatility and an oil market that looks well supplied in the near term, which might affect activity across our OFSE portfolio. Continued discipline from the world's largest producers and the pace of oil demand growth will remain important factors to monitor. Geopolitics remain another element of uncertainty across the oil and gas markets affecting macroeconomic conditions and upstream spending.
We are seeing customer spending trends shift more towards natural gas and low-carbon solutions, and we expect this trend to continue in 2025, which will continue to support strength across our IET portfolio. We remain optimistic on the LNG outlook, supporting the shift towards the development of natural gas and LNG. As a result, the global LNG project pipeline remains strong. Additionally, robust orders over the past few years are set to drive significant growth in our equipment installed base, which will underpin steady growth in Gas Technology Service over the coming years. Continued signs of tightness in the aeroderivative supply chain will remain an important factor to monitor.
Financial Results and Key Company Initiatives
In 2024, the Company generated revenues of $27.8 billion, compared to $25.5 billion in 2023, increasing $2.3 billion or 9%. The increase in revenue was driven principally by IET. IET revenue increased $2.1 billion, primarily driven by Gas Technology Equipment revenue. OFSE revenue increased $0.3 billion driven by international revenue. Operating income was $3.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2023, increasing $0.8 billion. The increase to operating income was driven by higher volume primarily from higher proportionate growth in Gas Technology Equipment ("GTE") and Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems ("SSPS") and price in both segments, and structural cost-out initiatives across the company, partially offset by cost inflation.
As our journey of transformation continues, we have made progress in our efforts to improve efficiencies and modernize how the business operates. The business has undertaken significant structural changes and we see the operating benefits coming through in the margin performance.
Baker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. We increased our quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2024 by one cent to $0.21 per share. For the full year of 2024, we returned a total of $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Outlook
Our business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.
•OFSE North America activity: In 2025, we expect a second consecutive year of lower E&P spending due to recent commodity price volatility and E&P consolidation.
•OFSE International activity: We expect spending outside of North America to be at similar or slightly lower levels in 2025 compared to 2024.
•IET outlook: We see continued strength in LNG, Floating Production Storage and Offloading ("FPSO"), gas infrastructure, and new energy, as well as increasing opportunities to leverage our versatile portfolio to enhance IET's position across industrial and distributed power markets. 
We have other businesses in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth. We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of the energy and broader industry, including: hydrogen; geothermal; CCUS; energy storage; clean power; and emissions abatement solutions. We expect to see continued growth in these global businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.
Overall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. Over time, we believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The following discussion and analysis summarize the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations, and their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.
Oil and Natural Gas Prices
Outside North America, customer spending is influenced by Brent oil prices. In North America, customer spending is influenced by WTI oil prices and natural gas prices are measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price.

Rig Count
Rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Therefore, rig counts may act as a leading indicator of market activity and reflect the relative strength of energy prices however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.
Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.
The rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.
Our consolidated statements of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which "goods" is required to include all sales of tangible products and "services" must include all other sales, including other service activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between "equipment" and "product services," where product services refer to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to "product services" simply as "services" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Our results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), unallocated corporate expenses, significant restructuring plans, impairment and other charges, inventory impairments, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 35


In evaluating the performance, we primarily use the following:
Volume: Volume is defined as the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. Volume also includes price, which is defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.
Foreign Exchange ("FX"): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.
(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation and benefits, and overhead costs.
Productivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume and price, foreign exchange, and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.

Fiscal Year 2024 to Fiscal Year 2023
Revenue increased $2,323 million, or 9%, to $27.8 billion. OFSE increased $268 million and IET increased $2,055 million.
Selling, general and administrative cost decreased $153 million, or 6%, to $2,458 million, and our Corporate costs, which are primarily reported within this financial measure, decreased $17 million, or 5%, to $363 million. These decreases were driven primarily by a continued focus on cost optimization, partially offset by inflationary pressure.
Restructuring, impairment, and other charges were $301 million in 2024, primarily related to streamlining of the OFSE operating model. In 2023, restructuring, impairment, and other charges were $323 million reflecting costs to align the business with the Company's market outlook.
Operating income increased $763 million, or 33%, to $3,081 million, driven primarily by: increased volume primarily from higher proportionate growth in GTE and SSPS, favorable price, cost optimization, and, to a lesser extent, FX, partially offset by inflationary pressure.
We recorded other non-operating income of $382 million in 2024, which included a net gain of $367 million from the change in fair value for certain equity investments. In 2023, we recorded $554 million of other non-operating income. Included in this amount was a net gain of $555 million from the change in fair value for certain equity investments.
Net interest expense incurred in 2024 was $198 million, which includes interest income of $93 million. Net interest expense decreased $18 million compared to 2023, with higher interest income primarily driven by higher average cash on deposit.
We recorded income taxes in 2024 and 2023 of $257 million and $685 million, respectively. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the $664 million reversal of a valuation allowance in 2024, with the rate in both years also reflecting income generated in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than in the U.S. and losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances. The valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets has been released as a result of the U.S. moving into a cumulative three-year profit position, which is supported by an increasing pattern of profitability, recent demonstration of tax credit utilization, and the forecasted continuation of profitability in the U.S.

(1)Operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenue.
OFSE revenue of $15,628 million increased $268 million, or 2%, in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by SSPS. From a geographical perspective, international revenue was $11,673 million, an increase of $428 million from 2023, primarily driven by the Europe/CIS/Sub-Saharan Africa regions, partially offset by the Latin America and Middle East/Asia regions. North America revenue was $3,955 million in 2024, a decrease of $161 million from 2023.
OFSE segment operating income was $1,988 million in 2024 compared to $1,746 million in 2023. The improved performance in 2024 was a result of higher price, cost-out initiatives, and, to a lesser extent, volume with higher proportionate growth in SSPS, partially offset by inflationary pressure.

IET revenue of $12,201 million increased $2,055 million, or 20%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily in GTE, and, to a lesser extent, in Gas Technology Services, CTS and Industrial Technology.
IET segment operating income was $1,830 million in 2024 compared to $1,310 million in 2023. The improved performance in 2024 was driven by higher volume primarily from higher proportionate growth in GTE, price, and cost-out initiatives, partially offset by inflationary pressure.
Fiscal Year 2023 to Fiscal Year 2022
Revenue increased $4,350 million, or 21%, to $25.5 billion. OFSE increased $2,131 million and IET increased $2,219 million.
Selling, general and administrative cost increased $101 million, or 4%, to $2,611 million, and our Corporate costs, which are primarily reported within this financial measure, decreased $36 million, or 9%, to $380 million. These decreases were driven primarily by cost optimization initiatives, partially offset by inflationary pressure.
In 2023, restructuring, impairment, and other charges were $323 million reflecting costs to align the business with the Company's market outlook. In 2022, restructuring, impairment, and other charges were $705 million primarily associated with the discontinuation of our Russia operations, and costs to facilitate the reorganization into two segments.
Operating income increased $1,133 million, or 96%, to $2,317 million, driven primarily by: increased volume primarily from higher proportionate growth in GTE and SSPS, favorable price, and continued benefit of cost optimization initiatives, partially offset by inflationary pressure.
We recorded other non-operating income of $554 million in 2023, which included a net gain of $555 million from the change in fair value for certain equity investments. In 2022, we recorded $911 million of other non-operating losses primarily due to the loss of $451 million from the sale of part of the OFSE business in Russia and a loss of

$265 million from the change in fair value for certain equity investments. Additionally, in December 2022, the Company, Baker Hughes Holdings, LLC ("BHH LLC") and GE entered into an agreement which resulted in the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement, and as a result, we incurred a charge of $81 million.
Net interest expense incurred in 2023 was $216 million, which includes interest income of $84 million. Net interest expense decreased $36 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher interest income.
We recorded income taxes in 2023 and 2022 of $685 million and $600 million, respectively. The difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate in both years was impacted by income in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than in the U.S. and losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances. In addition, the above noted impact to the effective tax rate in 2023 was partially offset by income subject to U.S. tax at an effective rate less than 21% due to valuation allowances while the effective rate in 2022 was further impacted by restructuring charges for which a majority had no tax benefit.

OFSE revenue of $15,361 million increased $2,131 million, or 16%, in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of increased activity as evidenced by an increase in the global rig count. From a geographical perspective, international revenue was $11,245 million, an increase of $1,779 million from 2022, primarily driven by the Middle East/Asia and Latin America regions, partially offset by lower volume due to the discontinuation of our Russia operations that occurred in 2022. North America revenue was $4,116 million in 2023, an increase of $352 million from 2022.
OFSE segment operating income was $1,746 million in 2023 compared to $1,201 million in 2022. The improved performance in 2023 was primarily driven by higher volume, price and cost-out initiatives, partially offset by inflationary pressure and lower cost productivity.

IET revenue of $10,145 million increased $2,219 million, or 28%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher volume in Gas Technology Equipment and, to a lesser extent, in CTS, Industrial Technology and Gas Technology Services.
IET segment operating income was $1,310 million in 2023 compared to $1,135 million in 2022. The improved performance in 2023 was driven by higher volume primarily from higher proportionate growth in GTE, price and cost-out initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable cost productivity, inflationary pressure, and higher research and development costs related to new energy investments.
COMPLIANCE
In the conduct of all of our activities, we are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System. We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program ("Compliance Program") which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.
Highlights of our Compliance Program include the following:
•Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.
•Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating allegations across all regions and countries where we do business.
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 41


•Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.
•Due diligence and monitoring procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), and administrative service providers.
•Due diligence procedures for acquisition activities.
•Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.
•Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as segment compliance review boards that meet quarterly.
•Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a conflict of interest reporting and management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.
•Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements.
•A compliance program designed to create an "Open Reporting Environment" where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages.
•Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies.
•Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties.
•We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire training module which includes compliance training for all employees.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. We continue to maintain solid financial strength and sufficient liquidity. At December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2023.
In the U.S. we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and outside the U.S. of approximately $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held outside the U.S. at December 31, 2024 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate certain cash to the U.S., we may incur other additional taxes that would not be significant to the total tax provision.
We have a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility ("the Credit Agreement") with commercial banks maturing in November 2028. The Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants, in each case we consider customary. No related events of default have occurred. The Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Baker Hughes. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
Certain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See "Note 9. Debt" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Our next debt maturity is December 2026.
We continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a global pandemic, or a significant decline in oil and gas 
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 42


prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, and repurchases of our common stock.
Cash Flows
Cash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:

(In millions)                       2024            2023            2022

Financing activities         (1,527)         (2,028)         (1,592)    
Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $3,332 million, $3,062 million, and $1,888 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Our largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services, including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and others for a wide range of goods and services.
Cash from operating activities is primarily generated from net income or loss adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, gain or loss on equity securities, stock-based compensation cost, deferred tax benefit or provision, and the impairment of certain assets).
In 2024, net working capital cash generation was $7 million, mainly due to progress collections mostly offset by an increase in receivables, inventory, and contract assets as the business continues to expand. Included in the cash flows from operating activities in 2024 are payments of $217 million made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities.
In 2023, net working capital cash generation was $42 million, mainly due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts, mostly offset by an increase in receivables and inventory due to expansion of the business.
In 2022, net working capital cash generation was $122 million primarily due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in receivables and inventory due to growth of the business.
Investing Activities
Cash flows used in investing activities were $1,016 million, $817 million, and $1,564 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures including property, plant and equipment ("PP&E") and software, to support and generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets were $1,278 million, $1,224 million, and $989 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the disposal of PP&E of $203 million, $208 million, and $217 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets are primarily related to equipment that was lost-in-hole, predominantly in OFSE, and PP&E no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period.
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 43


We had proceeds from the sale of certain equity securities of $92 million, $372 million, and $26 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
In 2023, we completed the acquisition of businesses for total cash consideration of $301 million, net of cash acquired, which consisted primarily of the acquisition of Altus Intervention in the OFSE segment. We also completed the sale of businesses and received total cash consideration of $293 million, which consisted primarily of the sale of our Nexus Controls business in the IET segment. In 2022, we completed the acquisition of businesses for total cash consideration of $767 million, net of cash acquired, including BRUSH Power Generation, Quest Integrity, AccessESP, and Mosaic Materials.
The Central Bank of Argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access U.S. dollars and remit cash from our Argentine operations. There is an indirect foreign exchange mechanism known as a Blue Chip Swap that enables companies to transfer U.S. dollars out of and into Argentina, effectively at a parallel U.S. dollar exchange rate. In 2024 and 2023, we entered into transactions in order to remit cash from our Argentine operations resulting in a net loss and a net cash outflow of $7 million and $66 million, respectively, which is included in other investing activities.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used in financing activities were $1,527 million, $2,028 million, and $1,592 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
In 2024, we repaid long-term debt of $143 million primarily related to debentures that matured in the second quarter of 2024. In 2023, we repaid long-term debt of $651 million primarily related to certain senior notes that matured in December of 2023. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend by one cent to $0.21 per share during the first quarter of 2024. We paid dividends of $836 million, $786 million, and $726 million to our Class A stockholders in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
We repurchased and canceled 15.2 million, 16.3 million, and 29.7 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of $484 million, $538 million, and $828 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Cash Requirements
We believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, access to our uncommitted lines of credit, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity in the short-term and long-term to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, repay debt, repurchase our common stock, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies.
Our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2025 will be made at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business.
Based on our current outlook, we anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion in 2025.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, leases for property and equipment, and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. Certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors.
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 44


See "Note 9. Debt" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our long-term debt. See "Note 8. Leases" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our operating leases.
As of December 31, 2024, we had expected cash payments for estimated interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $249 million payable within the next twelve months and $2,468 million payable thereafter.
As of December 31, 2024, we had purchase obligations of $1,855 million payable within the next twelve months and $679 million payable thereafter. Our purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2025 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $602 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations discussed above. See "Note 11. Income Taxes" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.
Other Factors Affecting Liquidity
Registration Statement: In December 2023, Baker Hughes, together with BHH LLC and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. There were no sales of such securities during the year ended December 31, 2024. The registration statement will expire in December 2026.
Customer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. With regard to our primary customer in Mexico, there have not historically been any material losses due to uncollectible accounts receivable, nor are any such balances currently in dispute. During 2024, the Company issued credit default swaps ("CDS") in the total of $553 million to third-party financial institutions. The CDS relate to borrowings provided by these financial institutions to our primary customer in Mexico who utilized these borrowings to pay certain of the Company's outstanding receivables. The total notional amount remaining on the issued CDS was $412 million as of December 31, 2024, which will reduce each month through September 2026 as the customer repays the borrowings. The fair value of these derivative liabilities is not material.
A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results of operations. As of December 31, 2024, 16% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S. and 10% were from customers in Mexico. As of December 31, 2023, 19% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S. and 11% were from customers in Mexico. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our gross customer receivables at this date.
International operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 82% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2024. Depending on the jurisdiction or country where this cash is held, we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.

Guarantor Financial Information
We guarantee various senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured debentures (collectively, the "Debt Securities") outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $5,797 million as of December 31, 2024, with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2047. The Debt Securities constitute debt obligations of BHH LLC, an indirect, 100% owned subsidiary and the primary operating company of Baker Hughes, and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc, a 100% owned finance subsidiary of BHH LLC (together with BHH LLC, the "Issuers") that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a corporate co-obligor of debt securities. The Debt Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other senior and unsecured debt obligations. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Baker Hughes and the Issuers.
As required under SEC Rule 13-01, we have included summarized financial information for the Issuers because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Issuers are materially different than the corresponding amounts in our consolidated financial statements due to the release of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
The Audit Committee of the Board has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment, but they are not deemed critical as defined above.

Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements
We have long-term service agreements with our customers, primarily within our IET segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have an average contract term of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an over time basis using input methods to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.
To develop our billing estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.
To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
We routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods.
Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $(11) million, $15 million and $20 million for the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 11% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs.
Revenue Recognition on Sale of Customized Equipment
We recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have historically promised, and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss. The total revenue recognized for the sale of equipment on an over time basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $8.5 billion, $6.1 billion, and $4.2 billion, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets
We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the existence of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if we conclude otherwise, we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 47


and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples, and comparable transactions.
Other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, which involves significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.
The determination of whether goodwill and other long-lived assets are impaired involves a significant level of judgment and estimation, and changes in our forecasts, business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions, among other things, could significantly impact these judgments, potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units or long-lived assets. Any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and U.S. GAAP in various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our rate may be further impacted by the repatriation of foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent the repatriation would result in additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We routinely assess the recoverability of such assets, weighing available positive and negative evidence and recording a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the assets will not be realized. In undertaking such assessment, we first look to objective and verifiable evidence, the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses, if any, based on a rolling three-year period, recent earnings history and associated trends or changes, and the nature of temporary differences, including predictability of reversal patterns and duration of carryforward. We then also evaluate other evidence such as projected financial results, sensitivity of such results to external factors or changes in assumptions, and prudent and readily available tax planning strategies that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary differences. While we consider all available positive and negative evidence, certain objectively verifiable categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis. For example, concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. While this would not be the sole determinate of the need for a valuation allowance, it does carry greater weight within the broader assessment when alongside other, more subjective evidence, including projections for future growth.
Our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $455 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2024. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current creditworthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. 
Baker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 48


For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses totaled $232 million and $350 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required.
