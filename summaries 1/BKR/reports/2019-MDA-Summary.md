## General Sentiment

Baker Hughes Company is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 68,000 employees. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS).

## Management Commentary

For management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 please refer to Part II, Item 7 "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019.

## Challenges and Risks

Throughout 2019, the industry experienced continued volatility, with North America activity declining versus 2018, and growth internationally. Offshore markets remained relatively stable, with approximately 300 subsea trees being awarded. 2019 was a strong year for liquefied natural gas (LNG) related markets, with 71 million tons per annum of final investment decisions being reached on projects.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

We have implemented a strategy to mitigate risk, including the Master Agreement Framework, which focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers. This framework includes defining the parameters for long-term collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology, maintaining the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil and-gas applications, and addressing outstanding matters under existing long-term commercial agreements.

## Noteworthy Extras

We have entered into a $3 billion committed revolving credit facility with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. We have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility.
