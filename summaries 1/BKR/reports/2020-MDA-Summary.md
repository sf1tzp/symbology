## Challenges and Risks

We operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.

## Noteworthy Extras

We have taken necessary actions to right-size the business for expected activity levels. In the first quarter of 2020, we approved a plan for restructuring and other actions totaling $1.8 billion, which was increased by $0.3 billion as we took further actions during the year to address the continuing industry challenges. Total restructuring and other costs were $2.1 billion in 2020. These charges are primarily related to the costs for reductions in workforce, product line exits in certain geographies, and the write down of inventory and intangible assets. These actions took place across the business and our corporate functions. We expect the cash payback of these actions to be less than one year.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

In 2020, we recorded inventory impairments of $246 million, primarily related to our Oilfield Services segment as a result of certain restructuring activities initiated by the Company. There were no other inventory impairments in 2020.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

During the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly driven by current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions including the decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices driven by both surplus production and supply. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14,773 million during the first quarter of 2020. There were no other goodwill impairments in 2020.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

In 2020, we recorded restructuring, impairment and other charges of $1,866 million, compared to $342 million in 2019. These charges primarily relate to the restructuring plan announced in the first quarter of 2020, which include product line rationalization actions, headcount reductions in certain geographies, and the write down of inventory and intangible assets.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

In 2020, we recorded separation and merger related costs of $134 million, a decrease of $50 million from the prior year. Costs in 2020 relate to the ongoing activities for the separation from GE including costs for the build-out of certain information technology infrastructures as a result of the separation.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

In 2020, we recorded other non-operating income (loss), net of $1,040 million, compared to $(84) million in 2019. Included in this amount is an unrealized gain of $1,417 million related to marking our investment in C3.ai to fair value, partially offset by losses of $353 million for the sale of our Rod Lift Systems and our Surface Pressure Control Flow businesses in OFE.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

In 2020, we recorded interest expense, net of $264 million, an increase of $27 million, compared to $237 million in 2019.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

In 2020, our income tax expense was $559 million, an increase of $77 million, compared to $482 million in 2019.
