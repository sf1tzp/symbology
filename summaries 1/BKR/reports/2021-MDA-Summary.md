### Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

For management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019 please refer to Part II, Item 7. "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 25, 2021.

### Executive Summary

We are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services ("OFS"), Oilfield Equipment ("OFE"), Turbomachinery &amp; Process Solutions ("TPS"), and Digital Solutions ("DS"). We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments.

As we reflect on the macro environment in 2021, the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The oil markets experienced increasing levels of demand and continued restraints on supply translating into a strong oil price recovery. For natural gas, a combination of demand and supply factors converged, pushing natural gas and LNG prices to record levels in both Europe and in Asia. The natural gas price spikes also highlighted the fragility of the global energy system as the world transitions to net zero emissions. The effects from variant strains of the COVID-19 virus continued to impact operations in the form of global chip shortages, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures in multiple parts of the world.

As we look ahead to 2022, we expect global economic growth to remain strong; however, growth rates are likely to moderate from 2021 levels as central banks are expected to begin tightening monetary policy in order to quell growing inflationary pressures. Despite the expected slowdown in the pace of growth, we believe the expected continuing broader macro recovery will translate into rising energy demand in 2022, with oil demand likely recovering to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. We expect continued momentum in the global natural gas markets in 2022, building on a strong 2021. Our positive long-term view on gas is also supported by the recent improvements in policy sentiment in certain parts of the world towards natural gas’ broader role within the energy transition.

Outside of the oil and gas industry, the focus on cleaner energy sources and technology to lower carbon emissions from resource-intensive industries continues to accelerate. In the U.S., Europe, and Asia, various renewables, and green and blue hydrogen projects are moving forward, as well as a number of CCUS projects. On the new energy front, we were active this year in pursuing early-stage technologies in CCUS and in hydrogen. In CCUS, we acquired a position in Electrochaea, a bio-methanation company, and also entered into an exclusive license with SRI International for mixed-salt process technology. In hydrogen, we made an investment in Ekona, a growth stage company developing novel turquoise hydrogen production technology, as well as Nemesys, a technology company focused on a range of early-stage hydrogen technologies.

On the industrial front, we completed the acquisition of ARMS Reliability and an investment in Augury, which will help Baker Hughes continue to build out its industrial asset management platform and deliver an expanded set of asset performance capabilities.

Baker Hughes was successful on many fronts in 2021, with key commercial successes and developments in the LNG and new energy markets, as well as strong margin improvements, as well as strong cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure defined as cash flows from operating activities less expenditures for capital assets plus the proceeds from disposal of assets). Our strong cash flow performance provides our Company ample flexibility and optionality for our broader capital allocation strategy. As evidence of this, we returned almost $1.2 billion back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2021, while also making multiple acquisitions and investments across the industrial and new energy spaces.

In 2021, we generated revenue of $20.5 billion, compared to $20.7 billion in 2020. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower volume in OFS and OFE, partially offset by higher volume in TPS and DS. Income before income taxes was $428 million in 2021, and included restructuring, impairment and other charges of $209 million, separation related costs of $60 million, a loss of $1,085 million related to our investment in C3 AI, partially offset by a gain of $241 million related to our investment in ADNOC Drilling, both recorded in other non-operating income. Loss before income taxes was $15.2 billion in 2020, and included goodwill impairment charges of $14.8 billion, restructuring, impairment and other charges of $1.9 billion, inventory impairment charges of $246 million, separation related costs of $134 million, and a gain of $1.4 billion related to our investment in C3 AI recorded in other non-operating income.

OUTLOOK

Our business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.

•North America onshore activity: We expect North American onshore to experience strong growth in 2022, as compared to 2021 should commodity prices remain at current levels.

•International onshore activity: We expect onshore spending outside of North America to continue to improve in 2022 as compared to 2021 should commodity prices remain at current levels.

•Offshore projects: We expect a modest recovery in offshore activity and the number of subsea tree awards to grow in 2022 as compared to 2021.

•LNG projects: We remain optimistic on the LNG market long term and view natural gas as both a transition and a destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.

We have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth, such as our Digital Solutions segment.

We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of energy and broader industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, CCUS, and energy storage. We expect to see continued growth in these businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.

Overall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the oil and gas industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility. Over time, we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world’s energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.

### Business Environment

The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company.

Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.

Oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.

2021                                                           2020
Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)              $70.86         $41.96    
WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)                 68.14          39.16    
Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)            3.89           2.03    
(1)Energy Information Administration ("EIA") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel
(2)EIA Cushing, OK WTI ("West Texas Intermediate") spot price
(3)EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit
After a volatile year in 2020, when oil prices dropped due to lower demand, the combination of demand and supply in 2021 resulted in higher oil prices and raised natural gas and LNG prices to record breaking levels.

Outside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. The average Brent oil
