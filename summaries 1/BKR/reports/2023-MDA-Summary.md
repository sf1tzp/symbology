**We are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our two business segments: OFSE and IET. We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments, as well as broader industrial and new energy markets.**

**During 2023, Baker Hughes built strong momentum across the Company with significant improvement in our financial results over 2022. In OFSE, we saw key commercial successes and solid margin improvements, and in IET, we benefited from robust growth in LNG orders, driving RPO to levels that provides meaningful revenue visibility. Overall, we capitalized on market tailwinds to deliver strong revenue growth across both segments, began realizing the full benefits of our cost-out initiatives, and continued to transform how we operate. We also achieved significant growth in new energy orders compared to 2022 as we continue to experience growing demand for decarbonization solutions across the Company’s IET and OFSE portfolios.**

**As we look to 2024, we remain balanced on the oil and gas outlook but continue to see areas of strength across our portfolio despite persisting economic uncertainty. We continue to believe in a multiyear upstream spending cycle, which, we believe, will be more durable and less sensitive to commodity price swings relative to prior cycles and led by international and offshore markets. Continued discipline from the world’s largest producers and the pace of oil demand growth in the face of economic uncertainty, will remain important factors to monitor as we look into 2024. Oil and gas prices have experienced volatility in the fourth quarter of 2023 and beginning of 2024, and this will likely have some influence on upstream development plans, particularly for shorter-cycle spending budgets.**

**Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East has added another element of uncertainty across the oil and gas markets. While this conflict has not had a material impact on our operations, a further escalation in geopolitical tensions across the region could impact the Company. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the conflict in the Middle East on our business. Furthermore, in IET, the aeroderivative supply chain continues to show signs of tightness, which we will continue to manage operationally.**

**We also remain optimistic on the LNG outlook, seeing a continued shift towards the development of natural gas and LNG. As a result, the LNG project pipeline remains strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. As the world increasingly recognizes the crucial role natural gas is expected to play in the energy transition, serving as both a transition and destination fuel, we believe it will be fundamental in satisfying the world’s energy needs for many decades to come.**

**Financial Results**

**In 2023, the Company generated revenue of $25.5 billion, compared to $21.2 billion in 2022, increasing $4.4 billion or 21%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher volume in IET on Gas Technology Equipment project backlog execution and stronger activity in OFSE. Income before tax was $2,655 million in 2023 compared to $22 million in 2022, increasing $2,633 million. The increase in income before tax was driven by higher volume and price in both segments and structural cost-out initiatives, positive effect from the change in fair value on certain equity securities, and lower restructuring and impairment charges.**

**Our journey of transformation continues. The business has undertaken significant structural changes, and we see the cost-out performance coming through our operating results. We have made significant progress; however, there is still more work to do to further identify areas to simplify and create efficiencies and modernize how the business operates, including actions launched in OFSE to remove duplication and further streamline the business.**

**Baker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. We increased our quarterly dividend in the third quarter of 2023 by one cent to $0.20 per share. For the full year of 2023, we returned a total of $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest in the Baker Hughes portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2023, we completed the acquisition of Altus Intervention, a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhole technology, which significantly enhances OFSE’s existing portfolio. We also completed the sale of the Nexus Controls business in April 2023.**

**Outlook**

**Our business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.  All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.**

**•OFSE North America activity: After trending lower most of 2023 due to lower activity from private exploration & production operators and in gas basins, North American activity has recently stabilized. However, we see a slow start to 2024 and anticipate only a modest recovery in activity during the second half of 2024. **

**•OFSE International activity: We expect spending outside of North America to experience moderate growth in 2024, as compared to 2023. **

**•IET LNG projects: We remain optimistic on the LNG market long-term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive. **

**We have other businesses in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth. We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of the energy and broader industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, CCUS, energy storage, clean power and emissions abatement solutions. We expect to see continued growth in these businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.**

**Overall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the oil and gas industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility. Over time, we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world’s energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.**

**BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT**

**Our revenue is predominantly generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations, and their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.**
