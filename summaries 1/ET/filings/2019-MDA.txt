ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Tabular dollar and unit amounts, except per unit data, are in millions)
Energy Transfer LP is a Delaware limited partnership whose common units are publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ET.” ET was formed in September 2002 and completed its initial public offering in February 2006.
The following discussion of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Partnership” and “ET” mean Energy Transfer LP and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include ETO, ETP GP, ETP LLC, Panhandle, Sunoco LP and Lake Charles LNG. References to the “Parent Company” mean Energy Transfer LP on a stand-alone basis.
OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer LP directly and indirectly owns equity interests in ETO, Sunoco LP and USAC, all of which are limited partnerships engaged in diversified energy-related services. Sunoco LP and USAC have publicly traded common units.
The Parent Company’s principal sources of cash flow are derived from its direct and indirect investments in the limited partner and general partner interests in ETO. ETO’s earnings and cash flows are generated by its subsidiaries, including ETO’s investments in Sunoco LP and USAC. The amount of cash that ETO, Sunoco LP and USAC distribute to their respective partners, including the Parent Company, each quarter is based on earnings from their respective business activities and the amount of available cash, as discussed below.
In order to fully understand the financial condition and results of operations of the Parent Company on a stand-alone basis, we have included discussions of Parent Company matters apart from those of our consolidated group.
General
Our primary objective is to increase the level of our distributable cash flow to our unitholders over time by pursuing a business strategy that is currently focused on growing our subsidiaries’ natural gas and liquids businesses through, among other things, pursuing certain construction and expansion opportunities relating to our subsidiaries’ existing infrastructure and acquiring certain strategic operations and businesses or assets. The actual amounts of cash that we will have available for distribution will primarily depend on the amount of cash our subsidiaries generate from their operations.
Our reportable segments are as follows:

•   intrastate transportation and storage;

•   interstate transportation and storage;

•   midstream;

•   NGL and refined products transportation and services;

•   crude oil transportation and services;

•   investment in Sunoco LP;

•   investment in USAC; and

•   all other.
The general partner of ETO has separate operating management and boards of directors. We control ETO through our owner ship of its respective general partners.

Regulatory Update
Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Regulation
Rate Regulation
Effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related proposals, the FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. The FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost of service rates. The FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that the FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership would not “double recover” its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost of service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing and clarification of its Revised Policy Statement. In the rehearing order, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors’ income tax costs. In light of the rehearing order, the impacts of the FERC’s policy on the treatment of income taxes may have on the rates ETO can charge for the FERC-regulated transportation services are unknown at this time. 
The FERC also issued a Notice of Inquiry (“2017 Tax Law NOI”) on March 15, 2018, requesting comments on the effect of the Tax Act on FERC jurisdictional rates. The 2017 Tax Law NOI states that of particular interest to the FERC is whether, and if so how, the FERC should address changes relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation. Comments in response to the 2017 Tax Law NOI were due on or before May 21, 2018.
In March 2019, following the decision of the D.C. Circuit in Emera Maine v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry regarding its policy for determining return on equity (“ROE”). The FERC specifically sought information and stakeholder views to help the FERC explore whether, and if so how, it should modify its policies concerning the determination of ROE to be used in designing jurisdictional rates charged by public utilities. The FERC also expressly sought comment on whether any changes to its policies concerning public utility ROEs should be applied to interstate natural gas and oil pipelines. Initial comments were due in June 2019, and reply comments were due in July 2019. The FERC has not taken any further action with respect to the Notice of Inquiry as of this time, and therefore we cannot predict what effect, if any, such development could have on our cost-of-service rates in the future.
Also included in the March 15, 2018 proposals is a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NOPR”) proposing rules for implementation of the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with respect to natural gas pipeline rates. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in the NOPR with a few clarifications and modifications. With limited exceptions, the Final Rule requires all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines that have cost-based rates for service to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information and to make an election on how to treat its existing rates. The Final Rule suggests that this information will allow the FERC and other stakeholders to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act and the Revised Policy Statement on each individual pipeline’s rates. The Final Rule also requires that each FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline select one of four options to address changes to the pipeline’s revenue requirements as a result of the tax reductions: file a limited Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) Section 4 filing reducing its rates to reflect the reduced tax rates, commit to filing a general NGA Section 4 rate case in the near future, file a statement explaining why an adjustment to rates is not needed, or take no other action. For the limited NGA Section 4 option, the FERC clarified that, notwithstanding the Revised Policy Statement, a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership does not need to eliminate its income tax allowance but, instead, can reduce its rates to reflect the reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. Trunkline, ETC Tiger Pipeline, LLC and Panhandle filed their respective FERC Form No. 501-Gs on October 11, 2018. FEP, Lake Charles LNG and certain other operating subsidiaries filed their respective FERC Form No. 501-Gs on or about November 8, 2018, and Rover, FGT, Transwestern and MEP filed their respective FERC Form No. 501-Gs on or about December 6, 2018. 
By order issued January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle’s existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to determine whether the rates currently charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing.  Panhandle filed a cost and revenue study on April 1, 2019. Panhandle filed a NGA Section 4 rate case on August 30, 2019.
By order issued October 1, 2019, the Panhandle Section 5 and Section 4 cases were consolidated. An initial decision is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2021. By order issued February 19, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Southwest Gas’ existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to determine whether the rates currently charged by Southwest Gas are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing.  Southwest Gas filed a cost and revenue study on May 6, 2019.  On July 10, 2019, Southwest filed an Offer of Settlement in this Section 5 proceeding, which settlement was supported or not opposed by Commission Trial Staff and all active parties. The settlement was approved on October 29, 2019.
Sea Robin Pipeline Company filed a Section 4 rate case on November 30, 2018.  A procedural schedule was ordered with a hearing date in the 4th quarter of 2019.  Sea Robin Pipeline Company has reached a settlement of this proceeding, with a settlement filed July 22, 2019. The settlement was approved by the FERC by order dated October 17, 2019.
Even without action on the 2017 Tax Law NOI or as contemplated in the Final Rule, the FERC or our shippers may challenge the cost of service rates we charge. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many components, and tax-related changes will affect two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect the FERC’s determination of just and reasonable cost of service rates. Although changes in these two tax related components may decrease, other components in the cost of service rate calculation may increase and result in a newly calculated cost of service rate that is the same as or greater than the prior cost of service rate. Moreover, we receive revenues from our pipelines based on a variety of rate structures, including cost of service rates, negotiated rates, discounted rates and market-based rates. Many of our interstate pipelines, such as ETC Tiger Pipeline, LLC, MEP and FEP, have negotiated market rates that were agreed to by customers in connection with long-term contracts entered into to support the construction of the pipelines. Other systems, such as FGT, Transwestern and Panhandle, have a mix of tariff rate, discount rate, and negotiated rate agreements. We do not expect market-based rates, negotiated rates or discounted rates that are not tied to the cost of service rates to be affected by the Revised Policy Statement or any final regulations that may result from the March 15, 2018 proposals. The revenues we receive from natural gas transportation services we provide pursuant to cost of service based rates may decrease in the future as a result of the ultimate outcome of the NOI, the Final Rule, and the Revised Policy Statement, combined with the reduced corporate federal income tax rate established in the Tax Act. The extent of any revenue reduction related to our cost of service rates, if any, will depend on a detailed review of all of ETO’s cost of service components and the outcomes of any challenges to our rates by the FERC or our shippers.
Pipeline Certification
The FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 (“Pipeline Certification NOI”), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the Pipeline Certification NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. Comments in response to the Pipeline Certification NOI were due on or before July 25, 2018. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.
Interstate Common Carrier Regulation
The FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index, or PPI. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. The FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI plus 1.23 percent. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC liquids index to change transportation rates annually every July 1. With respect to liquids and refined products pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction, the Revised Policy Statement requires the pipeline to reflect the impacts to its cost of service from the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Act on Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6. This information will be used by the FERC in its next five year review of the liquids pipeline index to generate the index level to be effective July 1, 2021, thereby including the effect of the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Act in the determination of indexed rates prospectively, effective July 1, 2021. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate, including the determination of the appropriate liquids pipeline index, is based on many components, and tax related changes will affect two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect the FERC’s determination of the appropriate pipeline index. Accordingly, depending on the FERC’s application of its indexing rate methodology for the next five year term of index rates, the Revised Policy Statement and tax effects related to the Tax Act may impact our revenues associated with any transportation services we may provide pursuant to cost of service based rates in the future, including indexed rates. 
Trends and Outlook
We continue to evaluate and execute strategies to enhance unitholder value through growth, as well as the integration and optimization of our diversified asset portfolio. We intend to target a minimum distribution coverage ratio of 1.50x, thereby promoting a prudent balance between distribution rates and enhanced financial flexibility and strength while maintaining our investment grade ratings. We anticipate continued earnings growth in 2020 from the recently completed projects, as well as our current project backlog. We also continue to seek asset optimization opportunities through strategic transactions among us and our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and we expect to continue to evaluate and execute on such opportunities. As we have in the past, we will evaluate growth projects and acquisitions as such opportunities may be identified in the future, and we believe that the current capital markets are conducive to funding such future projects.
With respect to commodity prices, natural gas prices have remained comparatively low in recent months as associated gas from shale oil resources has provided additional supply to the market, increasing domestic supply to highs above 100 Bcf/d. Global oil and natural gas demand growth is likely to continue into the foreseeable future and will support U.S. production increases and, in turn U.S. natural gas export projects to Mexico as well as LNG exports. 
For crude oil, new pipelines that came online during 2019 have resulted in Permian barrels now pricing closer to other regional hubs, which is a departure from the substantial discounts seen a year ago. These pipelines have enabled Permian producers to realize higher crude oil revenues, supporting continued growth in the region. Crude oil exports from the U.S. are continuing to increase as a result, providing additional opportunity for U.S. midstream sector growth.
Results of Operations
We report Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as measures of segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as total Partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, inventory valuation adjustments, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts for unconsolidated affiliates based on the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates.  The use of Segment Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates as an analytical tool should be limited accordingly.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as reported for each segment in the table below, is analyzed for each segment in the section titled “Segment Operating Results.” Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of the Partnership’s fundamental business activities and 
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP measures.

Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately $1.7 billion, or 18%. The increase was primarily due to the impact of multiple revenue-generating assets being placed in service and recent acquisitions, as well as increased demand for services on existing assets. The impact of new assets and acquisitions was approximately $784 million, of which the largest increases were from increased volumes to our Mariner East pipeline and terminal assets due to the addition of pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018 (a $274 million impact to the NGL and refined products transportation and services segment), the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators (a $131 million impact to the NGL and refined products transportation and services segment), the ramp up of volumes on our Bayou Bridge system due to placing phase II in service in the second quarter of 2019 (a $60 million impact to our crude oil transportation and services segment), the Rover pipeline (a $78 million impact to the interstate transportation and storage segment), the addition of gas processing capacity to our Arrowhead gas plant (a $31 million impact to our midstream segment), placing our Permian Express 4 pipeline in service in October 2019 (a $26 million impact to our crude oil transportation and services segment) and the acquisition of USAC (a net impact of $131 million among the investment in USAC and all other segments). The remainder of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to stronger demand on existing assets, particularly due to increased throughput on our Bakken Pipeline system as well as increased production in the Permian, which impacted multiple segments. Additional discussion of these 
and other factors affecting Adjusted EBITDA is included in the analysis of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the “Segment Operating Results” section below.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased primarily due to the following:

•   an increase of $198 million recognized by the Partnership (excluding Sunoco LP and USAC, which are discussed below) primarily due to increases in ETO’s long-term debt;

•   an increase of $49 million recognized by USAC primarily attributable to higher overall debt balances and higher interest rates on borrowings under the credit agreement. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in borrowings under the credit agreement; and

•   an increase of $29 million recognized by Sunoco LP due to an increase in total long-term debt; offset by
Impairment Losses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments of $12 million related to the Southwest Gas operations within the interstate transportation and storage segment and $9 million related to our North Central operations within the midstream segment, both of which were primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, Sunoco LP recognized a $47 million write-down on assets held for sale related to its ethanol plant in Fulton, New York, and USAC recognized a $6 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments of $378 million and asset impairments of $4 million related to our midstream operations and asset impairments of $9 million related to idle leased assets in our crude operations. Sunoco LP recognized a $30 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment related to contractual rights. USAC recognized a $9 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets. Additional discussion on these impairments is included in “Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies” below.
Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Losses on interest rate derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from a decrease in forward interest rates and gains in 2018 resulted from an increase in forward interest rates. 
Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Commodity Risk Management Activities.  The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships.  Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation reserve adjustments were recorded for the inventory associated with Sunoco LP primarily driven by changes in fuel prices between periods.
Losses on Extinguishments of Debt. Amounts were related to Sunoco LP’s senior note and term loan redemption in January 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA Related to Unconsolidated Affiliates and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. See additional information in “Supplemental Information on Unconsolidated Affiliates” and “Segment Operation Results” below.
Adjusted EBITDA Related to Discontinued Operations. Amounts were related to the operations of Sunoco LP’s retail business that were disposed of in January 2018.
Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, income tax expense increased due to an increase in income before tax expense at our corporate subsidiaries and the recognition of a favorable state tax rate change in the prior period.

Segment Operating Results
We evaluate segment performance based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is one of the performance measures used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments.
The tables below identify the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as follows:

•   Segment margin, operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts represent the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements that are attributable to each segment.

•   Unrealized gains or losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments. These are the unrealized amounts that are included in cost of products sold to calculate segment margin. These amounts are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, the unrealized losses are added back and the unrealized gains are subtracted to calculate the segment measure.

•   Non-cash compensation expense. These amounts represent the total non-cash compensation recorded in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. This expense is not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and therefore is added back to calculate the segment measure.

•   Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have
83

control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates.
In the following analysis of segment operating results, a measure of segment margin is reported for segments with sales revenues. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented.
In addition, for certain segments, the sections below include information on the components of segment margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of segment margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin, and other margin. These components of segment margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of segment margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Volumes.  For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased primarily due to the impact of reflecting RIGS as a consolidated subsidiary beginning April 2018 and the impact of the Red Bluff Express pipeline coming online in May 2018, as well as the impact of favorable market pricing spreads.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase of $64 million in transportation fees, excluding the impact of consolidating RIGS beginning April 2018 as discussed below, primarily due to the Red Bluff Express pipeline coming online in May 2018, as well as new contracts;

•   a net increase of $11 million primarily due to the consolidation of RIGS beginning April 2018, resulting in increases in transportation fees, retained fuel revenues and operating expenses of $24 million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates of $9 million; and

•   an increase of $7 million in realized storage margin primarily due to a realized adjustment to the Bammel storage inventory of $25 million in 2018 and higher storage fees, partially offset by a $20 million decrease due to lower physical withdrawals; partially offset by

•   a decrease of $9 million in retained fuel revenues primarily due to lower gas prices; and

•   a decrease of $5 million in realized natural gas sales and other due to lower realized gains from pipeline optimization activity.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased as a result of the addition of new contracted volumes for delivery out of the Haynesville Shale, higher volumes on our Rover pipeline as a result of the full year availability of new supply connections, and higher throughput on Trunkline and Panhandle due to increased utilization of higher contracted capacity.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase in margin of $231 million from the Rover pipeline due to higher reservation and usage resulting from additional connections and utilization of additional compression;

•   an increase of $40 million in reservation and usage fees due to improved market conditions allowing us to successfully bring new volumes to the system at improved rates, primarily on our Transwestern, Tiger and Panhandle Eastern systems; and

•   an increase of $6 million from the Sea Robin pipeline due to higher rates resulting from the rate case filed in June 2019, as well as fewer third party supply interruptions on the Sea Robin system; partially offset by

•   an increase of $138 million in operating expense primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes of $126 million on the Rover pipeline system resulting from placing the final portions of this asset into service in November 2018, an increase of $24 million in transportation expense on Rover due to an increase in transportation volumes, an increase of $5 million in allocated overhead costs and additional operating expense of $4 million for assets acquired in June 2019, partially offset by lower gas imbalance and system gas activity of $15 million and lower storage capacity leased on the Panhandle Eastern system of $8 million;

•   an increase of $9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in insurance expense of $8 million, an increase in employee cost of $4 million, and an increase in allocated overhead costs of $3 million, partially offset by lower Ohio excise tax on our Rover system; and

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, throughput barrels on our Texas NGL pipeline system increased due to higher receipt of liquids production from both wholly-owned and third-party gas plants primarily in the Permian and North Texas regions. In addition, NGL transportation volumes on our Northeast assets increased due to the initiation of service on the Mariner East 2 pipeline system.
Refined products transportation volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to prior year due to the closure of a third party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting supply to our refined products transportation system. These decreases in volumes are partially offset by the initiation of service on the JC Nolan Pipeline in the third quarter of 2019.
NGL and refined products terminal volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the initiation of service on our Mariner East 2 pipeline system which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Average volumes fractionated at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators in July 2018 and February 2019, respectively.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase of $483 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $265 million increase resulting from the initiation of service on our Mariner East 2 pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2018, a $212 million increase resulting from higher throughput volumes received from the Permian region on our Texas NGL pipelines, a $29 million increase due to higher throughput volumes from the Barnett region, a $9 million increase from the Eagle Ford region, and a $9 million increase due to the
87

initiation of service on the JC Nolan Pipeline. These increases were partially offset by a $21 million decrease resulting from Mariner East 1 pipeline downtime, a $13 million decrease due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting refined product supply to our system, and a $5 million decrease due to the timing of deficiency fees on Mariner West;

•   an increase of $153 million in fractionation and refinery services margin primarily due to a $167 million increase resulting from the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators in July 2018 and February 2019, respectively, and higher NGL volumes from the Permian region feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility. This increase was partially offset by a reclassification between our fractionation and storage margins;

•   an increase of $136 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $171 million increase from the initiation of service of our Mariner East 2 pipeline which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a $7 million increase due to increased tank lease revenue from third-party customers. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million decrease in volumes and expense reimbursements from third parties on Mariner East 1, a $16 million decrease due to lower volumes from third party pipeline, truck and rail deliveries into our Marcus Hook terminal, a $5 million decrease due to fewer vessels exported out of our Nederland terminal, and a $4 million decrease due to the closure of a third party refinery during the third quarter of 2019; and

•   an increase of $12 million in storage margin primarily due to a reclassification between our storage and fractionation margins; partially offset by

•   a decrease of $30 million in marketing margin primarily due to capacity lease fees incurred by our marketing affiliate on our Mariner East 2 pipeline, offset by increased gains from our butane blending business due to more favorable market conditions and increased volumes, as well as increased optimization gains from the sale of NGL component products at our Mont Belvieu facility;

•   an increase of $52 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $26 million increase in employee and ad valorem tax expenses on our terminals, fractionation, and transportation operations, a $14 million increase in utility costs to operate our pipelines and our fifth and sixth fractionators which commenced July 2018 and February 2019, respectively, and an $8 million increase in maintenance project costs due to the timing of multiple projects on our transportation assets; and

•   an increase of $19 million in general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $10 million increase in allocated overhead costs, a $5 million increase in insurance expenses, a $4 million increase in legal fees, and a $2 million increase in employee costs.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase of $672 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to a $282 million increase resulting from higher throughput on our Texas crude pipeline system primarily due to increased production from the Permian region and contributions from capacity expansion projects placed into service, a $219 million increase in throughput on our Bakken pipeline, a favorable inventory valuation adjustment of
88

$111 million for the 2019 year as compared to an unfavorable inventory adjustment of $54 million for the 2018 year, partially offset by a $50 million reduction due to lower pipeline basis spreads net of hedges. We also realized a $66 million increase from higher volumes on our Bayou Bridge Pipeline, a $31 million increase due to the inclusion of assets acquired in 2019, and a $26 million increase primarily from higher throughput, ship loading and tank rental fees at our Nederland terminal; partially offset by a $54 million decrease from our Oklahoma assets resulting from lower volumes to the system as well as from the timing of a deficiency payment made in the prior year, $12 million decrease due to the closure of a third party refinery which was the primary customer utilizing one of our northeast crude terminals. The remainder of the offsetting decrease was primarily attributable to a change in the presentation of certain intrasegment transactions, which were eliminated in the current period presentation but were shown on a gross basis in revenues and operating expenses in the prior period; partially offset by

•   an increase of $23 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $30 million increase in throughput-related costs on existing assets and a $10 million increase due to the inclusion of expenses acquired in 2019, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in management fees as well as the impact of certain intrasegment transactions discussed above;

•   a decrease of $7 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to lower margin from jet fuel sales by our joint ventures.

The Investment in Sunoco LP segment reflects the consolidated results of Sunoco LP.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to the Investment in Sunoco LP segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   a decrease in operating costs of $76 million, primarily as a result of the conversion of 207 retail sites to commission agent sites during April 2018. These expenses include other operating expense, general and administrative expense and lease expense; and

•   an increase of $25 million related to Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations related to the divestment of 1,030 company-operated fuel sites to 7-Eleven in January 2018; and

•   an increase of $4 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to Sunoco LP’s investment in the JC Nolan joint venture; partially offset by

•   a decrease in the gross profit on motor fuel sales of $76 million (excluding the change in inventory fair value adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to lower fuel margins, a one-time benefit of approximately $25 million related to a cash settlement with a fuel supplier recorded in 2018 and an $8 million one-time charge related to a reserve for an open contractual dispute recorded in 2019, partially offset by an increase in gallons sold.

•   our investment in coal handling facilities; and

•   our Canadian operations, which were acquired in the SemGroup acquisition in December 2019 and include natural gas gathering and processing assets.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased due to the net impact of the following:

•   a decrease of $40 million in merger and acquisition expenses; partially offset by

•   a decrease of $36 million due to the contribution of CDM to USAC in April 2018, subsequent to which CDM is reflected in the Investment in USAC segment;

•   a decrease of $8 million due to lower gas prices and increased power costs; and

•   a decrease of $11 million due to lower revenue from our compressor equipment business.

Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately $2.2 billion, or 30%. The increase was primarily due to the impact of multiple revenue-generating assets being 
placed in service and recent acquisitions, as well as increased demand for services on existing assets. The impact of new assets and acquisitions was approximately $1.2 billion, of which the largest increases were from the Bakken pipeline (a $546 million impact to the crude oil transportation and services segment), the Rover pipeline (a $359 million impact to the interstate transportation and storage segment) and the acquisition of USAC (a net impact of $191 million among the investment in USAC and all other segments). The remainder of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to stronger demand on existing assets, particularly due to increased production in the Permian, which impacted multiple segments. Additional discussion of these and other factors affecting Adjusted EBITDA is included in the analysis of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the “Segment Operating Results” section below.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from assets recently placed in service. 
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased primarily due to the following:

•   an increase of $121 million recognized by ETO primarily related to an increase in long-term debt, including additional senior note issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities; and

•   an increase of $78 million due to the acquisition of USAC on April 2, 2018; partially offset by

•   a decrease of $65 million recognized by Sunoco LP primarily due to the repayment in full of its term loan and refinancing of its senior notes at lower rates.
Impairment Losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments of $378 million and asset impairments of $4 million related to our midstream operations and asset impairments of $9 million related to our crude operations idle leased assets. Sunoco LP recognized a $30 million indefinite-lived intangible impairment related to its contractual rights. USAC recognized a $9 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded goodwill impairments of $223 million related to the compression business, $229 million related to Panhandle, $262 million related to the interstate transportation and storage segment and $79 million related to the NGL and refined products transportation and services segment. Sunoco LP recognized goodwill impairments of $387 million in 2017, of which $102 million was allocated to continuing operations. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded an impairment to the property, plant and equipment of Sea Robin of $127 million. Additional discussion on these impairments is included in “Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies” below.
Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Gains (losses) on interest rate derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted from an increase in forward interest rates in 2018 and a decrease in forward interest rates in 2017, which caused our forward-starting swaps to change in value. 
Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Commodity Risk Management Activities. See discussion of the unrealized gains (losses) on commodity risk management activities included in the discussion of segment results below.
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation reserve adjustments were recorded for the inventory associated with Sunoco LP as a result of commodity price changes in between periods.
Losses on Extinguishments of Debt. Amounts were related to Sunoco LP’s senior note and term loan redemption in January 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA Related to Unconsolidated Affiliates and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. See additional information in “Supplemental Information on Unconsolidated Affiliates” and “Segment Operation Results” below.
Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded impairments to its investments in FEP of $141 million and HPC of $172 million. Additional discussion on these impairments is included in “Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies” below. 
Adjusted EBITDA Related to Discontinued Operations. Amounts were related to the operations of Sunoco LP’s retail business that were disposed of in January 2018.
Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts. 
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other provisions, the highest corporate federal income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, the Partnership recognized a deferred tax benefit of 1.81 billion in December 2017. For the year ended December 
2018, the Partnership recorded an income tax expense due to pre-tax income at its corporate subsidiaries, partially offset by a statutory rate reduction.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase of $314 million in realized natural gas sales and other due to higher realized gains from pipeline optimization activity;

•   a net increase of $14 million due to the consolidation of RIGS beginning in April 2018, resulting in increases in transportation fees, operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses of $73 million, $16 million and $6 million, respectively, and a decrease of $37 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates; and

•   an increase of $4 million in transportation fees, excluding the impact of consolidating RIGS as discussed above, primarily due to new contracts and the impact of the Red Bluff Express pipeline coming online in May 2018; partially offset by

•   a decrease of $33 million in realized storage margin primarily due to an adjustment to the Bammel storage inventory, lower storage fees and lower realized derivative gains.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, transported volumes reflected increases of 1,919 BBtu/d as a result of the initiation of service on the Rover pipeline; increases of 572 BBtu/d and 439 BBtu/d on the Panhandle and Trunkline pipelines, respectively, due to higher demand resulting from colder weather and increased utilization by the Rover pipeline; 375 BBtu/d on the Tiger pipeline as a result of production increases in the Haynesville Shale, and 145 BBtu/d on the Transwestern pipeline resulting from favorable market opportunities in the West, midcontinent and Waha areas from the Permian supply basin.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase of $359 million associated with the Rover pipeline with increases of $485 million in revenues, $105 million in net operating expenses and $21 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and other; and

•   an aggregate increase of $66 million in revenues, excluding the incremental revenue related to the Rover pipeline discussed above, primarily due to capacity sold at higher rates on the Transwestern and Panhandle pipelines; partially offset by

•   an increase of $11 million in operating expenses, excluding the incremental expenses related to the Rover pipeline discussed above, primarily due to increases in maintenance project costs due to scope and level of activity; and

•   a decrease of $6 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to lower margins on MEP due to lower rates on renewals of expiring long term contracts.

•   an increase of $79 million in non fee-based margin due to increased throughput volume in the North Texas and Permian regions;

•   an increase of $33 million in non fee-based margin due to higher crude oil and NGL prices; and

•   an increase of $5 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to higher earnings from our Aqua, Mi Vida and Ranch joint ventures; partially offset by

•   an increase of $67 million in operating expenses primarily due to increases of $20 million in outside services, $19 million in materials, $8 million in maintenance project costs, $7 million in ad valorem taxes, $6 million in employee costs and $6 million in office expenses; and

•   an increase of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher professional fees.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, NGL transportation volumes increased primarily due to increased volumes from the Permian region resulting from a ramp up in production from existing customers, higher throughput volumes on Mariner West driven by end-user facility constraints in the prior year and higher throughput from Mariner South resulting from increased export volumes.
Refined products transportation volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to prior year, primarily due to timing of turnarounds at third-party refineries in the Midwest and Northeast regions.
NGL and Refined products terminal volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to prior year, primarily due to more volumes loaded at our Nederland terminal as propane export demand increased and higher throughput volumes at our refined products terminals in the Northeast.
Average volumes fractionated at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased volumes from the Permian region, as well as an increase in fractionation capacity as our fifth fractionator at Mont Belvieu came online in July 2018.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase in transportation margin of $243 million primarily due to a $216 million increase resulting from increased producer volumes from the Permian region on our Texas NGL pipelines, a $31 million increase due to higher throughput volumes on Mariner West driven by end-user facility constraints in the prior period, a $15 million increase resulting from a reclassification between our transportation and fractionation margins, a $9 million increase due to higher throughput volumes from the Barnett region, a $5 million increase due to higher throughput volumes on Mariner South due to system downtime in the prior period and a $4 million increase in prior period customer credits. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million decrease resulting from lower throughput volumes on Mariner East 1 due to system downtime in 2018, a $14 million decrease due to lower throughput volumes from the Southeast Texas region and a $7 million decrease resulting from the timing of deficiency fee revenue recognition;

•   an increase in fractionation and refinery services margin of $96 million primarily due to a $106 million increase resulting from the commissioning of our fifth fractionator in July 2018 and a $7 million increase from blending gains as a result of improved market pricing. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million decrease resulting from a reclassification between our transportation and fractionation margins and a $2 million decrease from higher affiliate storage fees paid;

•   an increase in terminal services margin of $70 million due to a $36 million increase resulting from a change in the classification of certain customer reimbursements previously recorded in operating expenses, a $23 million increase at our Nederland terminal due to increased export demand and a $12 million increase due to higher throughput at our Marcus Hook Industrial Complex. These increases were partially offset by lower terminal throughput fees in part due to the sale of one of our terminals in April 2017;

•   an increase in marketing margin of $55 million due to a $48 million increase from our butane blending operations and a $22 million increase in sales of NGLs and other products at our Marcus Hook Industrial Complex due to more favorable market prices. These increases were partially offset by a $15 million decrease from the timing of optimization gains from our Mont Belvieu fractionators; and

•   an increase of $14 million to adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to improved contributions from our unconsolidated refined products joint venture interests; partially offset by

•   an increase of $126 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $30 million increase in costs to operate our fractionators and a $20 million increase in operating costs on our NGL pipelines as a result of higher throughput and the commissioning of our fifth fractionator in July 2018, a $36 million increase resulting from a change in the classification of certain customer reimbursements previously recorded as a reduction to operating expenses that are now classified as revenue following the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, increases of $24 million and $7 million to operating costs at our Marcus Hook and Nederland terminals, respectively, as a result of significantly higher volumes through both terminals in 2018, an $8 million increase to environmental reserves and a $1 million increase to overhead allocations and maintenance repairs performed on our refinery services assets; and

•   an increase of $10 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $6 million increase in overhead costs allocated to the segment, a $2 million increase in legal fees, a $1 million increase in management fees previously recorded in operating expenses and a $1 million increase in employee costs.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   an increase of $1.07 billion in segment margin (excluding unrealized losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to the following: a $586 million increase resulting from placing the Bakken pipeline in service in the second quarter of 2017, a $266 million increase resulting from higher throughput on our Texas crude pipeline system primarily due to increased production from Permian producers; and gains of $355 million due to more favorable basis spreads; partially offset by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment of $54 million for the 2018 year as compared to a favorable inventory valuation adjustment of $82 million for the 2017 year; and

•   an increase of $2 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to increased jet fuel sales from our joint ventures; partially offset by

•   an increase of $117 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $67 million increase to throughput related costs on existing assets; a $36 million increase resulting from placing the Bakken pipeline in service in the second quarter of 2017; a $26 million increase resulting from the addition of certain joint venture transportation assets in the second quarter of 2017; and a $5 million increase from ad valorem taxes; partially offset by an $17 million decrease in insurance and environmental related expenses; and

•   an increase of $4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increases associated with placing our Bakken Pipeline in service in the second quarter of 2017.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to the Investment in Sunoco LP segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   a decrease of $248 million in Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations primarily due to Sunoco LP’s retail divestment in January 2018; partially offset by

•   an increase of $109 million in inventory fair value adjustments due to changes in fuel prices between periods;

•   an increase of $14 million in margin primarily due to an increase in rental income as a result of the increase in commission agent sites in the current year, offset by decreases in the gross profit on motor fuel sales; and

•   a net decrease of $8 million in operating and selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to decreased rent expense.

Amounts reflected in our all other segment during the periods presented above primarily include:

•   a non-controlling interest in PES. Prior to PES’s reorganization in August 2018, ETO’s 33% interest in PES was reflected as an unconsolidated affiliate; subsequent the August 2018 reorganization, ETO holds an approximately 8% interest in PES and no longer reflects PES as an affiliate; and

•   our investment in coal handling facilities.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased due to the net impacts of the following:

•   a decrease of $98 million due to the contribution of CDM to USAC in April 2018, subsequent to which CDM is reflected in the Investment in USAC segment;

•   a decrease of $38 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates from our investment in PES primarily due to our lower ownership in PES subsequent to its reorganization, which resulted in PES no longer being reflected as an affiliate beginning in the third quarter of 2018;

•   a decrease of $4 million due to merger and acquisition expenses related to the Energy Transfer Merger in 2018; and

•   a decrease of $15 million due to a one-time fee received from a joint venture affiliate in 2017; partially offset by

•   an increase of $7 million due to lower transport fees resulting from the expiration of a capacity commitment on Trunkline pipeline;

•   an increase of $6 million due to a decrease in losses from mark-to-market of physical system gas; and

•   an increase of $7 million due to increased margin from ETO’s compression equipment business.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview
Parent Company Only
Subsequent to the Merger with ETO, substantially all of the Partnership’s cash flows are derived from distributions related to its investment in ETO, whose cash flows are derived from its subsidiaries, including ETO’s investments in Sunoco LP and USAC.
The Parent Company’s primary cash requirements are for general and administrative expenses, debt service requirements and distributions to its partners. The Parent Company currently expects to fund its short-term needs for such items with cash flows from its direct and indirect investments in ETO. The Parent Company distributes its available cash remaining after satisfaction of the aforementioned cash requirements to its Unitholders on a quarterly basis.
100

The Parent Company expects ETO and its respective subsidiaries and investments in Sunoco LP and USAC to utilize their resources, along with cash from their operations, to fund their announced growth capital expenditures and working capital needs; however, the Parent Company may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, as it deems prudent to provide liquidity for new capital projects of its subsidiaries or for other partnership purposes.
ETO
ETO’s ability to satisfy its obligations and pay distributions to the Parent Company will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business and weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of ETO’s management.
ETO currently expects capital expenditures in 2020 to be within the following ranges (excluding capital expenditures related to our investments in Sunoco LP and USAC):

                                                                                      Growth                         Maintenance

(1)   Includes capital expenditures related to ETO’s proportionate ownership of the Bakken, Rover, and Bayou Bridge pipeline projects and our proportionate ownership of the Orbit Gulf Coast NGL export project.
The assets used in our natural gas and liquids operations, including pipelines, gathering systems and related facilities, are generally long-lived assets and do not require significant maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not have any significant financial commitments for maintenance capital expenditures in our businesses. From time to time we experience increases in pipe costs due to a number of reasons, including but not limited to, delays from steel mills, limited selection of mills capable of producing large diameter pipe timely, higher steel prices and other factors beyond our control. However, we include these factors in our anticipated growth capital expenditures for each year.
ETO generally funds maintenance capital expenditures and distributions with cash flows from operating activities. ETO generally expects to funds growth capital expenditures with proceeds of borrowings under ETO credit facilities, along with cash from operations.
As of December 31, 2019, in addition to $253 million of cash on hand, ETO had available capacity under the ETO Credit Facilities of $1.71 billion. Based on ETO’s current estimates, ETO expects to utilize capacity under the ETO Credit Facilities, along with cash from operations, to fund ETO’s announced growth capital expenditures and working capital needs through the end of 2020; however, ETO may issue debt or equity securities prior to that time as ETO deems prudent to provide liquidity for new capital projects, to maintain investment grade credit metrics or other partnership purposes.
Sunoco LP
Sunoco LP’s primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under its $1.50 billion credit facility and the issuance of additional long-term debt or partnership units as appropriate given market conditions. At December 31, 2019, Sunoco LP had available borrowing capacity of $1.33 billion under its revolving credit facility and $21 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
In 2020, Sunoco LP expects to invest approximately $130 million in growth capital expenditures and approximately $45 million on maintenance capital expenditures. Sunoco LP may revise the timing of these expenditures as necessary to adapt to economic conditions.
USAC
The compression services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, expand and upgrade existing operations. USAC’s capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and it anticipates that its capital requirements will continue to consist primarily of, the following:

•   maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the operating capacity of its assets and extend their useful lives, to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining its existing business and related operating income; and

•   expansion capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to expand the operating capacity or operating income capacity of assets, including by acquisition of compression units or through modification of existing compression units to increase their capacity, or to replace certain partially or fully depreciated assets that were not currently generating operating income.
USAC classifies capital expenditures as maintenance or expansion on an individual asset basis. Over the long-term, USAC expects that its maintenance capital expenditure requirements will continue to increase as the overall size and age of its fleet increase. USAC currently plans to spend approximately $32 million in maintenance capital expenditures during 2020, including parts consumed from inventory.
Without giving effect to any equipment USAC may acquire pursuant to any future acquisitions, it currently has budgeted between $110 million and $120 million in expansion capital expenditures during 2020. As of December 31, 2019, USAC has binding commitments to purchase $49 million of additional compression units, all of which USAC expects to be delivered in 2020.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price of our products and services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, the successful integration of our acquisitions, and other factors.
Operating Activities
Changes in cash flows from operating activities between periods primarily result from changes in earnings (as discussed in “Results of Operations” above), excluding the impacts of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include recurring non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and non-cash compensation expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the periods presented primarily resulted from construction and acquisitions of assets, while changes in non-cash compensation expense resulted from changes in the number of units granted and changes in the grant date fair value estimated for such grants. Cash flows from operating activities also differ from earnings as a result of non-cash charges that may not be recurring such as impairment charges and allowance for equity funds used during construction. The allowance for equity funds used during construction increases in periods when ETO has a significant amount of interstate pipeline construction in progress. Changes in operating assets and liabilities between periods result from factors such as the changes in the value of derivative assets and liabilities, timing of accounts receivable collection, payments on accounts payable, the timing of purchases and sales of inventories, and the timing of advances and deposits received from customers.

Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper
Parent Company Credit Facility
In connection with the closing of the Energy Transfer Merger, on October 19, 2018, the Partnership repaid in full all outstanding borrowings under the facility and the facility was terminated.
ETO Credit Facilities
Borrowings under the ETO Credit Facilities are unsecured and initially guaranteed by Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations L.P.  Borrowings under the ETO Credit Facilities will bear interest at a eurodollar rate or a base rate, at our option, plus an applicable margin.  In addition, we will be required to pay a quarterly commitment fee to each lender equal to the product of the applicable rate and such lender’s applicable percentage of the unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the ETO Credit Facilities.  
We typically repay amounts outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities with proceeds from unit offerings or long-term notes offerings. The timing of borrowings depends on the Partnership’s activities and the cash available to fund those activities. The repayments of amounts outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities depend on multiple factors, including market conditions and expectations of future working capital needs, and ultimately are a financing decision made by management. Therefore, the balance outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities may vary significantly between periods. We do not believe that such fluctuations indicate a significant change in our liquidity position, because we expect to continue to be able to repay amounts outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities with proceeds from unit offerings or long-term note offerings.

The term loan agreement is unsecured and is guaranteed by our subsidiary, Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations L.P.

As of December 31, 2019, the ETO Five-Year Credit Facility had $4.21 billion outstanding, of which $1.64 billion was commercial paper.

The term loan facility and the revolving credit facility mature on February 25, 2024. The KAPS Facility matures on June 13, 2024. SemCAMS may incur additional term loans and revolving commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed C$250 million (US$193 million at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate), subject to receiving commitments for such additional term loans or revolving commitments from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.
Covenants Related to Our Credit Agreements
Covenants Related to the Parent Company
The Term Loan Facility and ET Revolving Credit Facility previously contained customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default, including a change of control event of default and limitations on incurrence of liens, new lines of business, merger, transactions with affiliates and restrictive agreements. Both facilities have been paid off and terminated.
Covenants Related to ETO
The agreements relating to the ETO senior notes contain restrictive covenants customary for an issuer with an investment-grade rating from the rating agencies, which covenants include limitations on liens and a restriction on sale-leaseback transactions.
The ETO Credit Facilities contain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) the Partnership’s and certain of the Partnership’s subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

•   incur indebtedness;

•   grant liens;

•   enter into mergers;

•   dispose of assets;

•   make certain investments;

•   make Distributions (as defined in the ETO Credit Facilities) during certain Defaults (as defined in the ETO Credit Facilities) and during any Event of Default (as defined in the ETO Credit Facilities);

•   engage in business substantially different in nature than the business currently conducted by the Partnership and its subsidiaries;

•   engage in transactions with affiliates; and

•   enter into restrictive agreements.
The ETO Credit Facilities applicable margin and rate used in connection with the interest rates and commitment fees, respectively, are based on the credit ratings assigned to our senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. The applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans under the ETO Five-Year Facility ranges from 1.125% to 2.000% and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.125% to 1.000%. The applicable rate for commitment fees under the ETO Five-Year Facility ranges from 0.125% to 0.300%.  The applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans under the ETO 364-Day Facility ranges from 1.250% to 1.750% and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.250% to 0.750%.

The ETO Credit Facilities also limit us, on a rolling four quarter basis, to a maximum Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as defined in the underlying credit agreements, of 5.0 to 1, which can generally be increased to 5.5 to 1 during a Specified Acquisition Period. Our Leverage Ratio was 4.04 to 1 at December 31, 2019, as calculated in accordance with the credit agreements.
The agreements relating to the Transwestern senior notes contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional debt, the sale of assets and the payment of dividends and specify a maximum debt to capitalization ratio.
Failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of our revolving credit facilities could require us to pay debt balances prior to scheduled maturity and could negatively impact the Partnership’s or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt and/or our ability to pay distributions to Unitholders.
Covenants Related to Panhandle
Panhandle is not party to any lending agreement that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation due to a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, nor would a reduction in any credit rating, by itself, cause an event of default under any of Panhandle’s lending agreements.
Panhandle’s restrictive covenants include restrictions on liens securing debt and guarantees and restrictions on mergers and on the sales of assets. A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of Panhandle’s debt.
Covenants Related to Sunoco LP
The Sunoco LP Credit Facility contains various customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including a change of control event of default, as defined therein. Sunoco LP’s Credit Facility requires Sunoco LP to maintain a Net Leverage Ratio of not more than 5.5 to 1. The maximum Net Leverage Ratio is subject to upwards adjustment of not more than 6.0 to 1 for a period not to exceed three fiscal quarters in the event Sunoco LP engages in certain specified acquisitions of not less than $50 million (as permitted under Sunoco LP’s Credit Facility agreement). The Sunoco LP Credit Facility also requires Sunoco LP to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Sunoco LP’s Credit Facility agreement) of not less than 2.25 to 1.

(1)   Interest payments on long-term debt are based on the principal amount of debt obligations as of December 31, 2019. With respect to variable rate debt, the interest payments were estimated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2019. To the extent interest rates change, our contractual obligations for interest payments will change. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion.

(2)   We define a purchase commitment as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for refined product and energy commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. Our estimated future variable price contract payment obligations are based on the December 31, 2019 market price of the applicable commodity applied to future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are established at the inception of the contract. Our estimated future fixed price contract payment obligations are based on the contracted fixed price under each commodity contract. Obligations shown in the table represent estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated.

(3)   Includes minimum guaranteed payments under service concession arrangements with New Jersey Turnpike Authority and New York Thruway Authority.

(4)   Expected contributions to fund our pension and postretirement benefit plans were included in “Other” above. Environmental liabilities, AROs, unrecognized tax benefits, contingency accruals and deferred revenue, which were included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets were excluded from the table above as the amounts do not represent contractual obligations or, in some cases, the amount and/or timing of the cash payments is uncertain.

(5)   Excludes net non-current deferred tax liabilities of $3.21 billion due to uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows for such liabilities.

Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies
The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules, and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. For further details on our accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the accrual for and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The natural gas industry conducts its business by processing actual transactions at the end of the month following the month of delivery. Consequently, the most current month’s financial results for the midstream, NGL and intrastate transportation and storage segments are estimated using volume estimates and market prices. Any differences between estimated results and actual results are recognized in the following month’s financial statements. Management believes that the operating results estimated for the year ended December 31, 2019 represent the actual results in all material respects.
Some of the other significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the timing of certain forecasted transactions that are hedged, the fair value of derivative instruments, useful lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization, purchase accounting allocations and subsequent realizability of intangible assets, fair value measurements used in the goodwill impairment test, market value of inventory, assets and liabilities resulting from the regulated ratemaking process, contingency reserves and environmental reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition.  Revenues for sales of natural gas and NGLs are recognized at the later of the time of delivery of the product to the customer or the time of sale. Revenues from service labor, transportation, treating, compression and gas processing, are recognized upon completion of the service. Transportation capacity payments are recognized when earned in the period the capacity is made available.
Our intrastate transportation and storage and interstate transportation and storage segments’ results are determined primarily by the amount of capacity our customers reserve as well as the actual volume of natural gas that flows through the transportation 
pipelines. Under transportation contracts, our customers are charged (i) a demand fee, which is a fixed fee for the reservation of an agreed amount of capacity on the transportation pipeline for a specified period of time and which obligates the customer to pay even if the customer does not transport natural gas on the respective pipeline, (ii) a transportation fee, which is based on the actual throughput of natural gas by the customer, (iii) fuel retention based on a percentage of gas transported on the pipeline, or (iv) a combination of the three, generally payable monthly. Excess fuel retained after consumption is typically valued at market prices.
Our intrastate transportation and storage segment also generates revenues and margin from the sale of natural gas to electric utilities, independent power plants, local distribution companies, industrial end-users and other marketing companies on the HPL System. Generally, we purchase natural gas from the market, including purchases from our marketing operations, and from producers at the wellhead.
In addition, our intrastate transportation and storage segment generates revenues and margin from fees charged for storing customers’ working natural gas in our storage facilities. We also engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time utilizing the Bammel storage reservoir. We purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide for a gross profit margin. We expect margins from natural gas storage transactions to be higher during the periods from November to March of each year and lower during the period from April through October of each year due to the increased demand for natural gas during colder weather. However, we cannot assure that management’s expectations will be fully realized in the future and in what time period, due to various factors including weather, availability of natural gas in regions in which we operate, competitive factors in the energy industry, and other issues.
Lake Charles LNG’s revenues from storage and re-gasification of natural gas are based on capacity reservation charges and, to a lesser extent, commodity usage charges. Reservation revenues are based on contracted rates and capacity reserved by the customers and recognized monthly. Revenues from commodity usage charges are also recognized monthly and represent the recovery of electric power charges at Lake Charles LNG’s terminal.
Results from the midstream segment are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered, compressed, treated, processed, purchased and sold through our pipeline and gathering systems and the level of natural gas and NGL prices. We generate midstream revenues and segment margins principally under fee-based or other arrangements in which we receive a fee for natural gas gathering, compressing, treating or processing services. The revenue earned from these arrangements is directly related to the volume of natural gas that flows through our systems and is not directly dependent on commodity prices. Our midstream segment also generates revenues from the sale of residue gas and NGLs at the tailgate of our processing facilities primarily to affiliates and some third-party customers.
We also utilize other types of arrangements in our midstream segment, including (i) discount-to-index price arrangements, which involve purchases of natural gas at either (1) a percentage discount to a specified index price, (2) a specified index price less a fixed amount or (3) a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount, (ii) percentage-of-proceeds arrangements under which we gather and process natural gas on behalf of producers, sell the resulting residue gas and NGL volumes at market prices and remit to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price, and (iii) keep-whole arrangements where we gather natural gas from the producer, process the natural gas and sell the resulting NGLs to third parties at market prices. In many cases, we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above. The terms of our contracts vary based on gas quality conditions, the competitive environment at the time the contracts are signed and customer requirements. Our contract mix may change as a result of changes in producer preferences, expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors.
We conduct marketing activities in which we market the natural gas that flows through our assets, referred to as on-system gas. We also attract other customers by marketing volumes of natural gas that do not move through our assets, referred to as off-system gas. For both on-system and off-system gas, we purchase natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply points and sell that natural gas to utilities, industrial consumers, other marketers and pipeline companies, thereby generating gross margins based upon the difference between the purchase and resale prices.
We have a risk management policy that provides for oversight over our marketing activities. These activities are monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations. As a result of our use of derivative financial instruments that may not qualify for hedge accounting, the degree of earnings volatility that can occur may be significant, favorably or unfavorably, from period to period. We attempt to manage this volatility through the use of daily position and profit and loss reports provided to senior management and predefined limits and authorizations set forth in our risk management policy.
We inject and hold natural gas in our Bammel storage facility to take advantage of contango markets, when the price of natural gas is higher in the future than the current spot price. We use financial derivatives to hedge the natural gas held in connection with these arbitrage opportunities. At the inception of the hedge, we lock in a margin by purchasing gas in the spot market or off peak 
season and entering a financial contract to lock in the sale price. If we designate the related financial contract as a fair value hedge for accounting purposes, we value the hedged natural gas inventory at current spot market prices along with the financial derivative we use to hedge it. Changes in the spread between the forward natural gas prices designated as fair value hedges and the physical inventory spot prices result in unrealized gains or losses until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related designated derivatives are settled. Once the gas is withdrawn and the designated derivatives are settled, the previously unrealized gains or losses associated with these positions are realized. Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses from our derivative instruments using mark-to-market accounting, with changes in the fair value of our derivatives being recorded directly in earnings. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical spot prices and forward natural gas prices. If the spread narrows between the physical and financial prices, we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains. Typically, as we enter the winter months, the spread converges so that we recognize in earnings the original locked in spread, either through mark-to-market or the physical withdrawal of natural gas.
NGL storage and pipeline transportation revenues are recognized when services are performed or products are delivered, respectively. Fractionation and processing revenues are recognized when product is either loaded into a truck or injected into a third-party pipeline, which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. 
In our natural gas compression business, revenue is recognized for compressor packages and technical service jobs using the completed contract method which recognizes revenue upon completion of the job. Costs incurred on a job are deducted at the time revenue is recognized.
Terminalling and storage revenues are recognized at the time the services are provided. Pipeline revenues are recognized upon delivery of the barrels to the location designated by the shipper. Crude oil acquisition and marketing revenues, as well as refined product marketing revenues, are recognized when title to the product is transferred to the customer. Revenues are not recognized for crude oil exchange transactions, which are entered into primarily to acquire crude oil of a desired quality or to reduce transportation costs by taking delivery closer to end markets. Any net differential for exchange transactions is recorded as an adjustment of inventory costs in the purchases component of cost of products sold and operating expenses in the statements of operations.
Investment in Sunoco LP
Sunoco LP’s revenues from motor fuel are recognized either at the time fuel is delivered to the customer or at the time of sale. Shipment and delivery of motor fuel generally occurs on the same day. Sunoco LP charges wholesale customers for third-party transportation costs, which are recorded net in cost of sales. Through PropCo, Sunoco LP’s wholly-owned corporate subsidiary, Sunoco LP may sell motor fuel to customers on a commission agent basis, in which Sunoco LP retains title to inventory, controls access to and sale of fuel inventory, and recognizes revenue at the time the fuel is sold to the ultimate customer. In Sunoco LP’s fuel distribution and marketing operations, Sunoco LP derives other income from rental income, propane and lubricating oils, and other ancillary product and service offerings. In Sunoco LP’s other operations, Sunoco LP derives other income from merchandise, lottery ticket sales, money orders, prepaid phone cards and wireless services, ATM transactions, car washes, movie rentals, and other ancillary product and service offerings. Sunoco LP records revenue from other retail transactions on a net commission basis when a product is sold and/or services are rendered.
Investment in USAC
USAC’s revenue from contracted compression, station, gas treating and maintenance services is recognized ratably under its fixed-fee contracts over the term of the contract as services are provided to its customers. Initial contract terms typically range from six months to five years. However, USAC usually continues to provide compression services at a specific location beyond the initial contract term, either through contract renewal or on a month-to-month or longer basis. USAC primarily enters into fixed-fee contracts whereby its customers are required to pay its monthly fee even during periods of limited or disrupted throughput. Services are generally billed monthly, one month in advance of the commencement of the service month, except for certain customers who are billed at the beginning of the service month, and payment is generally due 30 days after receipt of the invoice. Amounts invoiced in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned, at which time they are recognized as revenue.  The amount of consideration USAC receives and revenue it recognizes is based upon the fixed fee rate stated in each service contract.
USAC’s retail parts and services revenue is earned primarily on freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursable by its customers and maintenance work on units at its customers’ locations that are outside the scope of USAC’s core maintenance activities. Revenue from retail parts and services is recognized at the point in time the part is transferred or service is provided and control is transferred to the customer. At such time, the customer has the ability to direct the use of the benefits of such part or service after USAC has performed its services. USAC bills upon completion of the service or transfer of the parts, and payment is generally due 30 days after receipt of the invoice. The amount of consideration USAC receives and revenue it recognizes is based upon the invoice amount.  
Lease Accounting.  At the inception of each lease arrangement, we determine if the arrangement is a lease or contains an embedded lease and review the facts and circumstances of the arrangement to classify lease assets as operating or finance leases under Topic 842. The Partnership has elected not to record any leases with terms of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. 
Balances related to operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, accrued and other current liabilities, operating lease current liabilities and non-current operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases represent a small portion of the active lease agreements and are included in finance lease ROU assets, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current maturities in our consolidated balance sheets. The ROU assets represent the Partnership’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation of the Partnership to make minimum lease payments arising from the lease for the duration of the lease term. 
Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 20 years or greater. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at the sole discretion of the Partnership and lease extensions are evaluated on a lease-by-lease basis. Leases containing early termination clauses typically require the agreement of both parties to the lease. At the inception of a lease, all renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised are considered when determining the lease term. The depreciable life of lease assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. 
To determine the present value of future minimum lease payments, we use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Presently, because many of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Partnership applies its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of minimum lease payments. The operating and finance lease ROU assets include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. 
Minimum rent payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition, some leases require additional contingent or variable lease payments, which are based on the factors specific to the individual agreement. Variable lease payments the Partnership is typically responsible for include payment of real estate taxes, maintenance expenses and insurance.
For short-term leases (leases that have term of twelve months or less upon commencement), lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis and no ROU assets are recorded.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.  We utilize various exchange-traded and OTC commodity financial instrument contracts to limit our exposure to margin fluctuations in natural gas, NGL, crude oil and refined products. These contracts consist primarily of futures and swaps.
If we designate a derivative financial instrument as a cash flow hedge and it qualifies for hedge accounting, the change in the fair value is deferred in AOCI until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge’s change in fair value is recognized each period in earnings. Gains and losses deferred in AOCI related to cash flow hedges remain in AOCI until the underlying physical transaction occurs, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. For financial derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the change in fair value is recorded in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations.
If we designate a hedging relationship as a fair value hedge, we record the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability in cost of products sold in our consolidated statement of operations. This amount is offset by the changes in fair value of the related hedging instrument. Any ineffective portion or amount excluded from the assessment of hedge ineffectiveness is also included in the cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of operations.
We utilize published settlement prices for exchange-traded contracts, quotes provided by brokers, and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts. Changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. We do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for further discussion regarding our derivative activities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  We have commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and embedded derivatives in our preferred units that are accounted for as assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. We determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement by using the highest possible “level” of inputs. Level 1 inputs are observable quotes in an active market for identical assets and liabilities. We consider the valuation of marketable securities and commodity derivatives transacted through a clearing broker with a published price from the appropriate exchange as a Level 1 valuation. Level 2 inputs are inputs observable for similar assets and liabilities. We consider OTC commodity derivatives entered into directly with third parties as a Level 2 valuation since the values of these derivatives are quoted on an exchange for similar transactions. Additionally, we consider our options transacted through our clearing broker as having Level 2 inputs due to the level of activity of these contracts on the exchange in which they trade. We consider the valuation of our 
interest rate derivatives as Level 2 as the primary input, the LIBOR curve, is based on quotes from an active exchange of Eurodollar futures for the same period as the future interest swap settlements. Level 3 inputs are unobservable. Derivatives related to the embedded derivatives in our preferred units are valued using a binomial lattice model. The market inputs utilized in the model include credit spread, probabilities of the occurrence of certain events, common unit price, dividend yield, and expected value, and are considered level 3. See further information on our fair value assets and liabilities in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.  Long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired. An impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is recognized when circumstances indicate that a decline in the investment value is other than temporary. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset/goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. 
In order to test for recoverability when performing a quantitative impairment test, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, we make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located, the availability and prices of natural gas, our ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements, the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful, our dependence on certain significant customers and producers of natural gas, and competition from other companies, including major energy producers. While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to calculate the fair value, if future results are not consistent with our estimates, we could be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
The Partnership determined the fair value of its reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. The Partnership believes the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, the Partnership determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit including estimates for capital expenditures, discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted industry rate, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit. Cash flow projections are derived from one year budgeted amounts and five year operating forecasts plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur. Under the guideline company method, the Partnership determined the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using a three year average. In addition, the Partnership estimated a reasonable control premium representing the incremental value that accrues to the majority owner from the opportunity to dictate the strategic and operational actions of the business.
One key assumption for the measurement of an impairment is management’s estimate of future cash flows and EBITDA. These estimates are based on the annual budget for the upcoming year and forecasted amounts for multiple subsequent years. The annual budget process is typically completed near the annual goodwill impairment testing date, and management uses the most recent information for the annual impairment tests. The forecast is also subjected to a comprehensive update annually in conjunction with the annual budget process and is revised periodically to reflect new information and/or revised expectations. The estimates of future cash flows and EBITDA are subjective in nature and are subject to impacts from the business risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period. Such changes in fair value estimates could result in additional impairments in future periods; therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period, resulting in additional impairments. 
Management does not believe that any of the goodwill balances in its reporting units is currently at significant risk of impairment; however, of the $5.2 billion of goodwill on the Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, approximately $380 million is recorded in reporting units for which the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 20% in the most recent quantitative test.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recorded the following impairments:

•   A $12 million impairment was recorded related to the goodwill associated with the Partnership’s Southwest Gas operations within the interstate segment primarily due to decreases in projected future revenues and cash flows. Additionally, the Partnership recorded a $9 million impairment related to the goodwill associated with the Partnership’s North Central operations within the midstream segment primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows.

•   Sunoco LP recognized a $47 million write-down on assets held for sale related to its ethanol plant in Fulton, New York.

•   USAC also recognized a $6 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership recorded the following impairments:

•   a $378 million impairment was recorded related to the goodwill associated with the Partnership’s Northeast operations within the midstream segment primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows from the dates the goodwill was originally recorded. These changes in assumptions reflect delays in the construction of third-party takeaway capacity in the Northeast. Additionally, the Partnership recorded asset impairments of $4 million related to our midstream operations and asset impairments $9 million related to our crude operations idle leased assets.

•   Sunoco LP also recognized a $30 million impairment charge on its contractual rights primarily due to decreases in projected future revenues and cash flows from the date the intangible assets were originally recorded.

•   USAC also recognized a $9 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded the following impairments:

•   a $223 million impairment was recorded related to the goodwill associated with CDM. In January 2018, the Partnership announced the contribution of CDM to USAC. Based on the Partnership’s anticipated proceeds in the contribution transaction, the implied fair value of the CDM reporting unit was less than the Partnership’s carrying value. As the Partnership believes that the contribution consideration also represented an appropriate estimate of fair value as of the 2017 annual impairment test date, the Partnership recorded an impairment for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit.

•   a $262 million impairment was recorded related to the goodwill associated with the Partnership’s interstate transportation and storage reporting units, and a $229 million impairment was recorded related to the goodwill associated with the general partner of Panhandle in the all other segment. These impairments were due to a reduction in management’s forecasted future cash flows from the related reporting units, which reduction reflected the impacts discussed in “Results of Operations” above, along with the impacts of re-contracting assumptions related to future periods.

•   a $79 million impairment was recorded related to the goodwill associated the Partnership’s refined products transportation and services reporting unit. Subsequent to the Sunoco Logistics Merger, the Partnership restructured the internal reporting of legacy Sunoco Logistics’ business to be consistent with the internal reporting of legacy ETO. Subsequent to this reallocation the carrying value of certain refined products reporting units was less than the estimated fair value due to a reduction in management’s forecasted future cash flows from the related reporting units, and the goodwill associated with those reporting units was fully impaired. No goodwill remained in the respective reporting units subsequent to the impairment.

•   a $127 million impairment of property, plant and equipment related to Sea Robin primarily due to a reduction in expected future cash flows due to an increase during 2017 in insurance costs related to offshore assets.

•   a $141 million impairment of the Partnership’s equity method investment in FEP. The Partnership concluded that the carrying value of its investment in FEP was other than temporarily impaired based on an anticipated decrease in production in the Fayetteville basin and a customer re-contracting with a competitor during 2017.

•   a $172 million impairment of the Partnership’s equity method investment in HPC primarily due to a decrease in projected future revenues and cash flows driven be the bankruptcy of one of HPC’s major customers in 2017 and an expectation that contracts expiring in the next few years will be renewed at lower tariff rates and lower volumes.

•   For 2017, Sunoco LP also recognized impairments of $404 million, of which $119 million was allocated to continuing operations, as discussed further below.
Except for the 2017 impairment of the goodwill associated with CDM, as discussed above, the goodwill impairments recorded by the Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 represented all of the goodwill within the respective reporting units.
During 2017, Sunoco LP announced the sale of a majority of the assets in its retail and Stripes reporting units. These reporting units include the retail operations in the continental United States but excludes the retail convenience store operations in Hawaii 
that comprise the Aloha reporting unit. Upon the classification of assets and related liabilities as held for sale, Sunoco LP’s management applied the measurement guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, to calculate the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group. In accordance with ASC 360-10-35-39, Sunoco LP’s management first tested the goodwill included within the disposal group for impairment prior to measuring the disposal group’s fair value less the cost to sell. In the determination of the classification of assets held for sale and the related liabilities, Sunoco LP’s management allocated a portion of the goodwill balance previously included in the Sunoco LP retail and Stripes reporting units to assets held for sale based on the relative fair values of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the respective reporting unit that will be retained in accordance with ASC 350-20-40-3.
Sunoco LP recognized goodwill impairments of $387 million in 2017, of which $102 million was allocated to continuing operations, primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows from the dates the goodwill was originally recorded.
Additionally, Sunoco LP performed impairment tests on its indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2017 and recognized a total of $17 million in impairment charges on their contractual rights and liquor licenses primarily due to decreases in projected future revenues and cash flows from the date the intangible assets were originally recorded.
Property, Plant and Equipment.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not add capacity or extend the useful life are expensed as incurred. Expenditures to refurbish assets that either extend the useful lives of the asset or prevent environmental contamination are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Additionally, we capitalize certain costs directly related to the construction of assets including internal labor costs, interest and engineering costs. Upon disposition or retirement of pipeline components or natural gas plant components, any gain or loss is recorded to accumulated depreciation. When entire pipeline systems, gas plants or other property and equipment are retired or sold, any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statement of operations. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 99 years. Changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on our results of operation. We do not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
Asset Retirement Obligations.  We have determined that we are obligated by contractual or regulatory requirements to remove facilities or perform other remediation upon retirement of certain assets. The fair value of any ARO is determined based on estimates and assumptions related to retirement costs, which the Partnership bases on historical retirement costs, future inflation rates and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. These fair value assessments are considered to be Level 3 measurements, as they are based on both observable and unobservable inputs. Changes in the liability are recorded for the passage of time (accretion) or for revisions to cash flows originally estimated to settle the ARO.
An ARO is required to be recorded when a legal obligation to retire an asset exists and such obligation can be reasonably estimated. We will record an ARO in the periods in which management can reasonably estimate the settlement dates.
Except for certain amounts discussed below, management was not able to reasonably measure the fair value of AROs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, in most cases because the settlement dates were indeterminable. Although a number of other onshore assets in Panhandle’s system are subject to agreements or regulations that give rise to an ARO upon Panhandle’s discontinued use of these assets, AROs were not recorded because these assets have an indeterminate removal or abandonment date given the expected continued use of the assets with proper maintenance or replacement. ETC Sunoco has legal AROs for several other assets at its previously owned refineries, pipelines and terminals, for which it is not possible to estimate when the obligations will be settled. Consequently, the retirement obligations for these assets cannot be measured at this time. At the end of the useful life of these underlying assets, ETC Sunoco is legally or contractually required to abandon in place or remove the asset. We believe we may have additional AROs related to ETC Sunoco’s pipeline assets and storage tanks, for which it is not possible to estimate whether or when the AROs will be settled. Consequently, these AROs cannot be measured at this time. Sunoco LP has AROs related to the estimated future cost to remove underground storage tanks.
Individual component assets have been and will continue to be replaced, but the pipeline and the natural gas gathering and processing systems will continue in operation as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists. Based on the widespread use of natural gas in industrial and power generation activities, management expects supply and demand to exist for the foreseeable future.  We have in place a rigorous repair and maintenance program that keeps the pipelines and the natural gas gathering and processing systems in good working order. Therefore, although some of the individual assets may be replaced, the pipelines and the natural gas gathering and processing systems themselves will remain intact indefinitely.
Other non-current assets on the Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet included $31 million and $26 million of legally restricted funds for the purpose of settling AROs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Legal Matters.  We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from claims, orders, judgments or settlements. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. We expense legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are revised as required as better information becomes available to us. The factors we consider when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of our legal counsel; (ii) our previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints.
For more information on our litigation and contingencies, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this report.
Environmental Remediation Activities. The Partnership’s accrual for environmental remediation activities reflects anticipated work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The accrual for known claims is undiscounted and is based on currently available information, estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. It is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations, changing technologies and their associated costs, and changes in the economic environment. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities.
Losses attributable to unasserted claims are generally reflected in the accruals on an undiscounted basis, to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. ETO has established a wholly-owned captive insurance company to bear certain risks associated with environmental obligations related to certain sites that are no longer operating. The premiums paid to the captive insurance company include estimates for environmental claims that have been incurred but not reported, based on an actuarially determined fully developed claims expense estimate. In such cases, ETO accrues losses attributable to unasserted claims based on the discounted estimates that are used to develop the premiums paid to the captive insurance company.
In general, each remediation site/issue is evaluated individually based upon information available for the site/issue and no pooling or statistical analysis is used to evaluate an aggregate risk for a group of similar items (e.g., service station sites) in determining the amount of probable loss accrual to be recorded. ETO’s estimates of environmental remediation costs also frequently involve evaluation of a range of estimates. In many cases, it is difficult to determine that one point in the range of loss estimates is more likely than any other. In these situations, existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued. Accordingly, the low end of the range often represents the amount of loss which has been recorded. The Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet reflected $320 million in environmental accruals as of December 31, 2019.
Total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon, among other things, the identification of any additional sites, the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site, the timing and nature of required remedial actions, the nature of operations at each site, the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements, the nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the availability of insurance coverage, the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations, inflation rates, terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of the Partnership’s liability at the sites, if any, in light of the number, participation level and financial viability of the other parties. The recognition of additional losses, if and when they were to occur, would likely extend over many years. Management believes that the Partnership’s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material. However, if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur or the assumptions used to estimate losses at multiple sites are adjusted, such changes could impact multiple facilities, formerly owned facilities and third-party sites at the same time. As a result, from time to time, significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur; however, management does not believe that any such charges would have a material adverse impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial position.
Deferred Income Taxes. ET recognizes benefits in earnings and related deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and tax credit carryforwards. If necessary, a charge to earnings and a related valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized by the Partnership in the future. Deferred income tax assets attributable to state and federal NOLs and federal tax alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards totaling $936 million have been included in ET’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The state NOL carryforward benefits of $149 million ($118 million net of federal benefit) begin to expire in 2020 with a substantial portion expiring between 2033 and 2039. ET’s corporate subsidiaries have federal NOLs of $3.42 billion ($718 million in benefits) of which $1.3 billion will expire between 2031 and 2037. Any federal NOL generated in 2018 and future years can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $15 million remained at December 31, 2019. We have determined that a valuation allowance totaling $62 million ($49 million net of federal income tax effects) is required for state NOLs as of December 31, 2019 primarily due to significant restrictions on their use in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A separate valuation allowance of $46 million
is attributable to foreign tax credits. In making the assessment of the future realization of the deferred tax assets, we rely on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income based on historical and projected future operating results. The potential need for valuation allowances is regularly reviewed by management. If it is more likely than not that the recorded asset will not be realized, additional valuation allowances which increase income tax expense may be recognized in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made.
Forward-Looking Statements
This annual report contains various forward-looking statements and information that are based on our beliefs and those of our General Partner, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

Inflation
Interest rates on existing and future credit facilities and future debt offerings could be significantly higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Although increased financing costs could limit our ability to raise funds in the capital markets, we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects since our competitors would face similar circumstances.
Inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and has not had a material effect on our results of operations. It may in the future, however, increase the cost to acquire or replace property, plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies. Our operating revenues and costs are influenced to a greater extent by commodity price changes. To the extent permitted by competition, regulation and our existing agreements, we have and will continue to pass along a portion of increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees.
