ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Tabular dollar and unit amounts, except per unit data, are in millions)
Energy Transfer LP is a Delaware limited partnership whose common units are publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ET.”
The following discussion of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Partnership” and “ET” mean Energy Transfer LP and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include ETO, ETP GP, ETP LLC, Panhandle, Sunoco LP and Lake Charles LNG. References to the “Parent Company” mean Energy Transfer LP on a stand-alone basis.
OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer LP directly and indirectly owns equity interests in ETO, Sunoco LP and USAC, all of which are limited partnerships engaged in diversified energy-related services. Sunoco LP and USAC have publicly traded common units.
We control ETO through our ownership of its general partner.
The Parent Company’s principal sources of cash flow are derived from its direct and indirect investments in the limited partner and general partner interests in ETO. ETO’s earnings and cash flows are generated by its subsidiaries, including ETO’s investments in Sunoco LP and USAC. The amount of cash that ETO, Sunoco LP and USAC distribute to their respective partners, including the Parent Company, each quarter is based on earnings from their respective business activities and the amount of available cash, as discussed below.
In order to fully understand the financial condition and results of operations of the Parent Company on a stand-alone basis, we have included discussions of Parent Company matters apart from those of our consolidated group.
General
Our primary objective is to increase the level of our distributable cash flow to our Unitholders over time by pursuing a business strategy that is currently focused on growing our subsidiaries’ natural gas and liquids businesses through, among other things, pursuing certain construction and expansion opportunities relating to our subsidiaries’ existing infrastructure and acquiring certain strategic operations and businesses or assets. The actual amounts of cash that we will have available for distribution will primarily depend on the amount of cash our subsidiaries generate from their operations.
Our reportable segments are as follows:
•intrastate transportation and storage;
•interstate transportation and storage;
•midstream;
•NGL and refined products transportation and services;
•crude oil transportation and services;
•investment in Sunoco LP;
•investment in USAC; and
•all other.
Recent Developments
COVID-19
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted several states and municipalities in which we operate to take extraordinary and wide-ranging actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus, including mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues or worsens, governments may impose additional similar restrictions. As a provider of critical energy infrastructure, our business has been designated as a “critical infrastructure sector” and our employees as “essential critical infrastructure workers” pursuant to the Department of Homeland Security Guidance on Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce(s). To date, our field operations have continued uninterrupted, and remote work and other COVID-19 related conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to maintain operations or caused us to incur significant additional expenses; however, we are unable to predict the magnitude or duration of current and potential future COVID-19 mitigation measures. As an essential business providing critical energy infrastructure, the safety of our employees and the continued operation of our assets are our top priorities and we will continue to operate in accordance with federal and state health guidelines and safety protocols. We have implemented several new policies and provided employee training to help maintain the health and safety of our workforce.
Pending Enable Acquisition
On February 17, 2021, the Partnership announced its entry into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Enable. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Enable’s common unitholders will receive 0.8595 of an ET common unit in exchange for each Enable common unit. In addition, each outstanding Enable Series A preferred unit will be exchanged for 0.0265 of an ET Series G preferred unit, and ET will make a $10 million cash payment for Enable’s general partner. The transaction is subject to the approval of Enable’s unitholders and other customary regulatory approvals.
ET Contribution of SemGroup Assets to ETO
On December 5, 2019, ET completed the acquisition of SemGroup. During the first and second quarters of 2020, ET contributed former SemGroup assets to ETO through sale and contribution transactions.
ETO Series F and Series G Preferred Units Issuance
On January 22, 2020, ETO issued 500,000 of its 6.750% Series F Preferred Units at a price of $1,000 per unit and 1,100,000 of its 7.125% Series G Preferred Units at a price of $1,000 per unit. The net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under ETO’s revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes. 
ETO January 2020 Senior Notes Offering and Redemption
Utilizing proceeds from the January 2020 Senior Notes Offering, ETO redeemed its $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due September 1, 2020, its $1.05 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.15% Senior Notes due October 1, 2020, its $1.14 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Senior Notes due October 15, 2020, its $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due February 15, 2020, ET’s $52 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Senior Notes due October 15, 2020 and Transwestern’s $175 million aggregate principal amount of 5.36% Senior Notes due December 9, 2020. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Financing Transactions” below for more information on the January 2020 Senior Notes Offering. 
Lake Charles LNG
On March 30, 2020, Shell announced that it would not proceed with a proposed equity interest in the Lake Charles LNG liquefaction project due to adverse market factors affecting Shell's business following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to develop the project, possibly in conjunction with one or more equity partners, and we plan to evaluate a variety of alternatives to advance the project, including the possibility of reducing the size of the project from three trains (16.45 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity) to two trains (11.0 million tonnes per annum). The project as currently designed is fully permitted by federal, state and local authorities, has all necessary export licenses and benefits from the infrastructure related to the existing regasification facility at the same site, including four LNG storage tanks, two deep water docks and other assets. In light of the existing brownfield infrastructure and the advanced state of the development of the project, we plan to continue to pursue the project on a disciplined, cost effective basis, and ultimately we will determine whether to make a final investment decision to proceed with the project based on market conditions, capital expenditure considerations and our success in securing equity participation by third parties as well as long-term LNG offtake commitments on satisfactory terms.
Sunoco LP November 2020 Senior Notes Offering and Repurchase
On November 9, 2020, Sunoco LP completed a private offering of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior notes due 2029. Sunoco LP used the proceeds to fund the tender offer on its 4.875% $1 billion senior notes due 2023. Approximately 56% of the 2023 senior notes were tendered. On January 15, 2021, Sunoco LP repurchased the remaining outstanding portion of its 2023 senior notes.
Regulatory Update
Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Regulation
Rate Regulation
Effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related proposals, the FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. The FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. The FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand 
from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that the FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership would not “double recover” its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost of service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing and clarification of its Revised Policy Statement. In the rehearing order, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors' income tax costs. On July 31, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC’s decision denying a separate master limited partnership recovery of an income tax allowance and its decision not to require the master limited partnership to refund accumulated deferred income tax balances. In light of the rehearing order’s clarification regarding individual entities’ ability to argue in support of recovery of an income tax allowance and the court’s subsequent opinion upholding denial of an income tax allowance to a master limited partnership, the impacts that FERC's policy on the treatment of income taxes may have on the rates ETO can charge for FERC-regulated transportation services are unknown at this time. 
Even without application of the FERC’s recent rate making-related policy statements and rulemakings, the FERC or our shippers may challenge the cost-of-service rates we charge. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many components, including ROE and tax-related components, although changes in these components may tend to decrease our cost-of-service rate, other components in the cost-of-service rate calculation may increase and result in a newly calculated cost-of-service rate that is less than, the same as, or greater than the prior cost-of-service rate. Moreover, we receive revenues from our pipelines based on a variety of rate structures, including cost-of-service rates, negotiated rates, discounted rates and market-based rates. Many of our interstate pipelines, such as ETC Tiger Pipeline, LLC, Midcontinent Express and Fayetteville Express, have negotiated market rates that were agreed to by customers in connection with long-term contracts entered into to support the construction of the pipelines. Other systems, such as FGT, Transwestern and Panhandle, have a mix of tariff rate, discount rate, and negotiated rate agreements. The revenues we receive from natural gas transportation services we provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates may decrease in the future as a result of the Revised Policy Statement, changes to ROE methodology, or other FERC policies, combined with the reduced corporate federal income tax rate established in the Tax Act. The extent of any revenue reduction related to our cost-of-service rates, if any, will depend on a detailed review of all of ETO’s cost-of-service components and the outcomes of any challenges to our rates by the FERC or our shippers.
On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a final rule establishing procedures to evaluate rates charged by the FERC-jurisdictional gas pipelines in light of the Tax Act and the FERC’s Revised Policy Statement. By order issued January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle’s existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether the rates currently charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing. Panhandle filed a cost and revenue study on April 1, 2019 and an NGA Section 4 rate case on August 30, 2019. The Section 4 and Section 5 proceedings were consolidated by order of the Chief Judge on October 1, 2019. A hearing in the combined proceedings commenced on August 25, 2020 and adjourned on September 15, 2020. By order dated January 19, 2021, the Chief Judge has extended the deadline for the initial decision to March 26, 2021.
Pipeline Certification
The FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 (“Pipeline Certification NOI”), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the Pipeline Certification NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. Comments in response to the Pipeline Certification NOI were due on or before July 25, 2018. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States. 
Interstate Common Carrier Regulation
The FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPI-FG. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC liquids index to change transportation rates annually. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. The FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. In a December 2020 order, FERC determined that during the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, common carriers charging indexed rates will be permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG plus 0.78 percent. Requests for rehearing of the December 2020 order were filed on January 19, 2021, and remain pending before FERC. Accordingly, the FERC’s final determination of the index rate coupled with the anticipated and subsequent appeals of the December 2020 order could adversely impact the final determination of the FERC approved index. 
FERC has also implemented changes related to its treatment of federal income taxes. The change in treatment impacts two rate components. Those components are the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes. These changes will primarily impact any cost-of-service related filing and our revenues associated with any cost-based service could be adversely affected by future FERC or judicial rulings. However, we believe that these impacts, if any, will be minimal. 
Trends and Outlook
Recent market disruptions involving the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted our earnings and cash flows from operations and may continue to do so. Reduced demand for natural gas, NGLs, refined products and/or crude oil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and low WTI crude oil prices may result in the continued shut-in of production from U.S. oil and gas wells, which in turn may result in decreased volumes transported on our pipeline systems and decreased overall utilization of our midstream services. 
With respect to commodity prices, natural gas prices have strengthened in recent months as a reduction in crude oil production has led to decreased supplies of associated natural gas from these wells. Meanwhile, crude oil prices saw a sharp decline as a result of actions by foreign oil-producing nations and a decrease in global demand as result of the COVID-19 pandemic but have subsequently risen and stabilized. We cannot predict the future impacts, or the duration of such impacts, from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The outlook for commodity prices is mixed and could have a varying impact on our business. Reduced demand and increased supply of crude oil has resulted in an increase in worldwide crude oil storage inventories, which is expected to keep crude oil prices depressed for the near term. With respect to natural gas markets, a relatively more moderate decrease in demand, coupled with the previously mentioned decreases in gas production associated with wells drilled to produce crude oil, have more than counterbalanced the reduction in demand. The overall outlook for our midstream services will depend, in part, on the timing and extent of recovery in the commodity markets. 
While we anticipate that current and projected commodity prices and the related impact to activity levels in both the upstream and midstream sectors will impact our business, we cannot predict the ultimate magnitude of that impact and expect it to be varied across our operations, depending on the region, customer, type of service, contract term and other factors.
While the vast majority of our counterparties are investment grade rated companies, recent market disruptions increased the likelihood that some of our counterparties may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. However, we believe that the recent increases in commodity prices, along with recent expense-cutting initiatives by many companies, have generally strengthened the credit profile for the majority of our producer counterparties.
Ultimately, the extent to which our business will be impacted by recent market developments depends on the factors described above as well as future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In response to these market events and uncertainties, we reduced 2020 growth capital spending, and we expect to continue to a lower level of growth capital spending going forward. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our forecasted capital expenditures. In 2020, we also reduced operating expenses, and we expect that our operating expenses going forward will continue to be lower relative to pre-2020 levels. While current market volatility makes the near-term unpredictable, we believe that overall the long-term demand for our services will continue given the essential nature of the midstream natural gas, NGLs, refined products and crude oil businesses, although we cannot predict any possible changes in such demand with reasonable certainty.
We currently have ample liquidity to fund our business and we do not anticipate any liquidity concerns in the immediate future (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below). In addition, while the trading price of ET common units declined significantly during the first nine months of 2020, thereby making equity capital market transactions less attractive in the near term, we continue to have access to the debt capital markets on generally favorable terms. In the event we seek additional equity or debt capital, our blended cost of capital for equity and debt is expected to be modestly higher in the near term; however, we will continue to evaluate growth projects and acquisitions as such opportunities may be identified in the future in light of this higher cost of capital.
In addition to the trends and outlook discussed above with respect to the Partnership’s existing business and finances, we also anticipate that the Partnership will continue to increase its focus on the development of alternative energy projects aimed at continuing to reduce its environmental footprint throughout its operations. In February 2021, the Partnership announced the creation of a new group focused on these efforts. The Partnership also recently announced its first-ever dedicated solar power contract, which will reduce the Partnership’s environmental footprint by integrating alternative energy sources when economically beneficial. 
Results of Operations
We report Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as measures of segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as total Partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, inventory valuation adjustments, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts for unconsolidated affiliates based on the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates. The use of Segment Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates as an analytical tool should be limited accordingly. 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as reported for each segment in the table below, is analyzed for each segment in the section titled “Segment Operating Results.” Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of the Partnership’s fundamental business activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP measures.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in the accounting policy related to certain barrels of crude oil.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.5%, primarily due to the impacts of lower volumes and market prices among several of our core operating segments resulting primarily from COVID-19 related demand reductions. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $136 million from our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment primarily due to higher throughput volumes, an increase of $68 million from our midstream segment primarily due to the restructuring and assignment of certain gathering and processing contracts, and an increase of $74 million from our investment in Sunoco LP segment primarily due to increased gross profit per gallon sold and a decrease in operating costs. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was also offset by a net increase of approximately $569 million from recent acquisitions and assets placed in service. 
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, decreased primarily due to the following:
•interest expenses recognized by the Partnership (excluding Sunoco LP and USAC) decreased by $8 million due to lower borrowing costs on both recently refinanced and floating rate debt, and higher capitalized interest offsetting a higher consolidated debt balance;
•an increase of $2 million recognized by USAC was primarily due to a full year of interest expense incurred in the current period on its senior notes 2027 issued in March 2019, partially offset by reduced borrowings and lower weighted average interest rates under its credit agreement; and
•an increase of $2 million recognized by Sunoco LP due to a slight increase in average long-term debt.
Impairment Losses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments totaling $2.2 billion and fixed asset impairments totaling $58 million, primarily due to decreases in projected future cash flows as a result of overall market demand decline. In addition, USAC recognized a goodwill impairment of $619 million as well as an equipment impairment of $8 million based on changes in market conditions.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments totaling $21 million primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, Sunoco LP recognized a $47 million write-down on assets held for sale related to its ethanol plant in Fulton, New York, and USAC recognized a $6 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
Losses on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Losses on interest rate derivatives decreased by $38 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year primarily due to a $400 million reduction in notional amount of outstanding forward-starting interest rate derivatives, which was partially offset by lower average interest rates and expenses related to the early termination and settlement of forward-starting interest rate derivatives.
Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation reserve adjustments were recorded for the inventory associated with Sunoco LP primarily driven by changes in fuel prices between periods.
Losses on Extinguishments of Debt. Year ended December 31, 2020 amounts were related to ETO Senior Note redemption in January 2020. In addition, Sunoco LP recognized a $13 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of its outstanding 2023 senior notes in 2020.
Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliate. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recorded an impairment to its investment in White Cliffs of $129 million due to a decrease in projected future revenues and cash flows as a result of the overall market demand decline that occurred subsequent to the SemGroup acquisition and related purchase price allocation in December 2019.

Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, income tax expense increased due to higher earnings from the Partnership’s consolidated corporate subsidiaries in 2020 and the impact of a current state tax benefit (net of federal benefit) of $17 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to a change in estimate related to state income taxes in 2019.

Segment Operating Results
We evaluate segment performance based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is one of the performance measures used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments.
The tables below identify the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as follows:
•Segment margin, operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts represent the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements that are attributable to each segment. 
•Unrealized gains or losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments. These are the unrealized amounts that are included in cost of products sold to calculate segment margin. These amounts are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, the unrealized losses are added back and the unrealized gains are subtracted to calculate the segment measure. 
•Non-cash compensation expense. These amounts represent the total non-cash compensation recorded in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. This expense is not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and therefore is added back to calculate the segment measure. 
•Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates.
In the following analysis of segment operating results, a measure of segment margin is reported for segments with sales revenues. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented. 
In addition, for certain segments, the sections below include information on the components of segment margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of segment margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin, and other margin. These components of segment margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of segment margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased primarily due to increased utilization of our Texas pipelines, partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the bankruptcy filing of a transportation customer. 
Segment Margin. The components of our intrastate transportation and storage segment margin were as follows:

                                                                                                    Years Ended December 31,

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $188 million in realized natural gas sales and other due to lower realized gains from pipeline optimization activity; and 
•a decrease of $2 million in retained fuel revenues primarily due to lower natural gas prices; offset by 
•an increase of $36 million in realized storage margin primarily due to higher realized gains on financial derivatives used to hedge physical storage gas;
•a decrease of $13 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $5 million decrease in outside services, a $4 million decrease in employee costs, a $3 million decrease in maintenance project costs and a $2 million decrease in ad valorem taxes; and
•an increase of $3 million in transportation fees primarily due to volume ramp-ups on Red Bluff Express pipeline and new contracts partially offset by the expansion of certain contracts on Regency Intrastate Gas Systems,

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, transported volumes decreased primarily due to lower crude production resulting in lower associated gas production and contract expirations on our Tiger Pipeline, as well as multiple weather events and maintenance of third-party facilities impacting our assets along the Gulf Coast.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $102 million in revenues primarily due to a decrease of $63 million from a contractual rate adjustment on commitments at our Lake Charles LNG facility effective January 2020, a decrease of $30 million due to additional revenue recognized in 2019 associated with a shipper bankruptcy, a decrease of $28 million due to lower utilization and lower rates on our Panhandle and Trunkline systems, a decrease of $12 million in transportation fees as a result of multiple weather events and maintenance on third-party facilities connected to our systems, and a decrease of $8 million resulting from contract expirations on ETC Tiger. These decreases were partially offset by higher reservation revenue on Transwestern and Rover resulting from higher contracted capacity and higher parking revenue resulting from timing of transactions; and
•a decrease of $26 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to lower earnings from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline primarily as a result of lower rates received following the expiration of certain contracts, partially offset by an increase from Citrus primarily due to higher revenues resulting from new contracts, rate increases on existing contracts, the recognition of a contract exit fee and lower operating expenses; partially offset by
•a decrease of $2 million in operating expense primarily due to $22 million in refunds of ad valorem taxes on Transwestern and lower current year assessments, a $13 million decrease in employee costs and a $9 million decrease in maintenance project costs resulting from cost-cutting initiatives, partially offset by $38 million in bad debt expense associated with a shipper bankruptcy and a $5 million increase related to the valuation of inventory on Panhandle; and
•a decrease of $13 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily resulting from a $17 million favorable settlement related to excise taxes on Rover and a $5 million decrease in employee costs due to cost-cutting initiatives, partially offset by a $4 million increase in legal and consulting fees related to an ongoing rate case and shipper bankruptcies and a $3 million increase in allocated overhead costs.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, gathered volumes decreased primarily in the South Texas and Northeast regions, partially offset by the impact of the SemGroup acquisition in the Mid-Continent/Panhandle region and volume growth in the Ark-La-Tex and Permian regions. NGL production increased due to the impact of the SemGroup acquisition in the Mid-Continent/Panhandle region and ethane uplift in the Permian, South Texas and North Texas regions.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our midstream segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $55 million in fee-based margin due to the impact of the SemGroup acquisition in the Mid-Continent/Panhandle region and recognized $103 million related to the restructuring and assignment of certain gathering and processing contracts in the Ark-La-Tex region, which included the recognition of $75 million of deferred revenue received in prior periods. This increase was partially offset by the impact of volume declines in the South Texas region;
•a decrease of $86 million in operating expenses due to cost-saving initiatives, including a decrease of $39 million in outside services, $25 million in materials, $14 million in employee costs and $8 million in office expenses; and
•a decrease of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses due to a decrease in allocated overhead costs resulting from overall corporate cost reductions; partially offset by
•a decrease of $70 million in non-fee-based margin due to unfavorable NGL prices of $75 million and favorable natural gas prices of $5 million; and
•a decrease of $11 million in non-fee-based margin due to decreased throughput volume, primarily in the South Texas region.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, NGL transportation volumes increased due to higher throughput volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system. In addition, throughput barrels on our Texas NGL pipeline system increased due to higher receipt of liquids production from both wholly-owned and third-party gas plants primarily in the Permian and North Texas regions, as well as higher export volumes feeding into our Nederland Terminal resulting from the initiation of service on our propane export pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Refined products transportation volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to prior year due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, which negatively impacted supply to our refined products transportation system, and less domestic demand for jet fuel and other refined products. These decreases in volumes were partially offset by the initiation of service of our JC Nolan diesel fuel pipeline in the third quarter of 2019.
NGL and refined products terminal volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019 and less domestic demand for jet fuel and other refined products. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes from our Mariner East system, an increase in loaded vessels at our Nederland Terminal, and the initiation of service on our JC Nolan diesel fuel pipeline and natural gasoline export project, both of which commences service in the third quarter of 2019.
Average fractionated volumes at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to the commissioning of our sixth and seventh fractionators in February 2019 and February 2020, respectively.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $179 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $128 million increase from higher throughput volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system, a $53 million increase from higher throughput volumes received from the Permian region, a $17 million increase due to the initiation of service on our JC Nolan diesel fuel pipeline in the third quarter of 2019, a $14 million increase from higher throughput volumes from the Barnett region, a $12 million increase from higher volumes from the South Texas region and a $3 million increase due to higher throughput on our Mariner West pipeline. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease from lower throughput volumes received from the Eagle Ford region, a $16 million decrease due to less demand for jet fuel and other refined products, and a $13 million decrease resulting from the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019;
•an increase of $62 million in fractionators and refinery services margin primarily due to a $57 million increase resulting from the commissioning of our sixth and seventh fractionators in February 2019 and February 2020, respectively, and higher NGL volumes from the Permian and Barnett regions feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility, and a $9 million increase in rail and truck volumes feeding our refinery services facility. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease due primarily to an expiration of a third-party blending contract during the second quarter of 2020;
•an increase of $27 million in storage margin primarily due to a $16 million increase from throughput fees generated from exported volumes and an $11 million increase from component product storage fees; and
•a decrease of $11 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower allocated overhead costs and lower employee costs resulting from cost-cutting initiatives; partially offset by
•a decrease of $89 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $90 million decrease resulting from an expiration of a third-party contract at our Nederland Terminal in the second quarter of 2020, a $29 million decrease due to lower third-party and intercompany volumes feeding our Marcus Hook Terminal, a $16 million decrease due to lower expense reimbursements in 2020, and a $14 million decrease due to less domestic demand for jet fuel and other refined products. These decreases were partially offset by a $60 million increase due to higher throughput on our Mariner East system; and
•a decrease of $56 million in marketing margin primarily due to an $87 million decrease due to lower margin from our butane blending business, a $37 million decrease in gasoline blending and optimization due primarily to unfavorable market conditions primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by a $47 million increase due to higher optimization gains from the sale of NGL component products at our Mont Belvieu facility and a $21 million increase in NGL export and rack volumes.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, crude transportation volumes were lower on our Texas pipeline system and our Bakken pipeline, driven by lower production in these regions due to lower crude oil prices as well as lower refinery utilization caused by COVID-19 demand destruction, partially offset by contributions from assets acquired in 2019. Crude terminal volumes were higher due to contributions from assets acquired in 2019, partially offset by lower Permian and Bakken pipeline volumes, reduced refinery utilization, and reduced export demand at our Nederland Terminal.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $693 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to a $430 million decrease from our Texas crude pipeline system due to lower utilization and lower average tariff rates realized, a $286 million decrease (excluding a net change of $84 million in unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) from our crude oil acquisition and marketing business primarily due to a significant contraction in spreads in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily impacting our Permian to Gulf Coast and Bakken to Gulf Coast trading operations, a $224 million decrease due to lower volumes on our Bakken Pipeline due to lower basin production, and a $35 million decrease in throughput at our crude terminals primarily driven by lower Permian and Bakken volumes, reduced refinery utilization from COVID-19 demand destruction, reduced export demand, and hurricanes impacting operations in the third quarter of 2020; partially offset by a $285 million increase related to assets acquired in 2019; and
•an increase of $33 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to legal expenses, higher insurance expenses, and an increase related to assets acquired in 2019; partially offset by
•a decrease of $44 million in operating expenses primarily due to lower volume-driven pipeline expenses and corporate cost-cutting initiatives, partially offset by increased costs related to assets acquired in 2019; and

Amounts reflected in our all other segment primarily include:
•our natural gas marketing operations; 
•our wholly-owned natural gas compression operations; 
•our investment in coal handling facilities.
•our Canadian operations, which were acquired in the SemGroup acquisition in December 2019 and include natural gas
gathering and processing assets.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $97 million from the acquisition of Energy Transfer Canada; and
•an increase of $26 million primarily due to insurance proceeds received on settled claims related to our MTBE litigation; partially offset by 
•a decrease of $22 million due to lower coal royalties and producer demand from our natural resources business;
•a decrease of $35 million due to lower revenue from our compressor equipment business;
•a decrease of $12 million from adverse market conditions due to COVID-19 related demand destruction;
•a decrease of $28 million due to higher merger and acquisition expenses;
•a decrease of $10 million due to intercompany eliminations; and
•a decrease of $6 million due to the elimination of Sunoco LP’s interest in the JC Nolan Joint Venture.

Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately $1.58 billion, or 16%. The increase was primarily due to the impact of multiple revenue-generating assets being placed in service and recent acquisitions, as well as increased demand for services on existing assets. The impact of new assets and acquisitions was approximately $784 million, of which the largest increases were from increased volumes to our Mariner East pipeline and terminal assets due to the addition of pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018 (a $274 million impact to the NGL and refined products transportation and services segment), the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators (a $131 million impact to the NGL and refined products transportation and services segment), the ramp up of volumes on our Bayou Bridge system due to placing phase II in service in the second quarter of 2019 (a $60 million impact to our crude oil transportation and services segment), the Rover pipeline (a $78 million impact to the interstate transportation and storage segment), the addition of gas processing capacity to our Arrowhead gas plant (a $31 million impact to our midstream segment), placing our Permian Express 4 pipeline in service in October 2019 (a $26 million impact to our crude oil transportation and services segment) and the acquisition of USAC (a net impact of $131 million among the investment in USAC and all other segments). The remainder of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to stronger demand on existing assets, particularly due to increased throughput on our Bakken Pipeline system as well as increased production in the Permian, which impacted multiple segments. Additional discussion of these and other factors affecting Adjusted EBITDA is included in the analysis of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the “Segment Operating Results” section below.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from assets recently placed in service. 
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased primarily due to the following:
•an increase of $198 million recognized by the Partnership (excluding Sunoco LP and USAC, which are discussed below) primarily due to increases in ETO’s long-term debt.
•an increase of $49 million recognized by USAC primarily attributable to higher overall debt balances and higher interest rates on borrowings under the credit agreement. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in borrowings under the credit agreement; and
•an increase of $29 million recognized by Sunoco LP due to an increase in total long-term debt.
Impairment Losses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments of $12 million related to the Southwest Gas operations within the interstate transportation and storage segment and $9 million related to our North Central operations within the midstream segment, both of which were primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, Sunoco LP recognized a $47 million write-down on assets held for sale related to its ethanol plant in Fulton, New York, and USAC recognized a $6 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments of $378 million and asset impairments of $4 million related to our midstream operations and asset impairments of $9 million related to idle leased assets in our crude operations. Sunoco LP recognized a $30 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment related to contractual rights. USAC recognized a $9 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets. Additional discussion on these impairments is included in “Critical Accounting Estimates” below. 
Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Losses on interest rate derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from a decrease in forward interest rates and gains in 2018 resulted from an increase in forward interest rates.
Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation reserve adjustments were recorded for the inventory associated with Sunoco LP primarily driven by changes in fuel prices between periods.
Losses on Extinguishments of Debt. Amounts were related to Sunoco LP’s senior note and term loan redemption in January 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA Related to Unconsolidated Affiliates and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. See additional information in “Supplemental Information on Unconsolidated Affiliates” and “Segment Operation Results” below.
Adjusted EBITDA Related to Discontinued Operations. Amounts were related to the operations of Sunoco LP’s retail business that were disposed of in January 2018.
Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts. 
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, income tax expense increased due to an increase in income at our corporate subsidiaries and the recognition of a favorable state tax rate change in the prior period.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased primarily due to the impact of reflecting RIGS as a consolidated subsidiary beginning April 2018 and the impact of the Red Bluff Express pipeline coming online in May 2018, as well as the impact of favorable market pricing spreads.
Segment Margin. The components of our intrastate transportation and storage segment margin were as follows:

                                                                                                    Years Ended December 31,

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $64 million in transportation fees, excluding the impact of consolidating RIGS beginning April 2018 as discussed below, primarily due to the Red Bluff Express pipeline coming online in May 2018, as well as new contracts; 
•a net increase of $11 million primarily due to the consolidation of RIGS beginning April 2018, resulting in increases in transportation fees, retained fuel revenues and operating expenses of $24 million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates of $9 million; and
•an increase of $7 million in realized storage margin primarily due to a realized adjustment to the Bammel storage inventory of $25 million in 2018 and higher storage fees, partially offset by a $20 million decrease due to lower physical withdrawals; partially offset by 
•a decrease of $9 million in retained fuel revenues primarily due to lower gas prices; and
•a decrease of $5 million in realized natural gas sales and other due to lower realized gains from pipeline optimization activity.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased as a result of the addition of new contracted volumes for delivery out of the Haynesville Shale, higher volumes on our Rover pipeline as a result of the full year availability of new supply connections, and higher throughput on Trunkline and Panhandle due to increased utilization of higher contracted capacity.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase in margin of $231 million from the Rover pipeline due to higher reservation and usage resulting from additional connections and utilization of additional compression;
•an increase of $40 million in reservation and usage fees due to improved market conditions allowing us to successfully bring new volumes to the system at improved rates, primarily on our Transwestern, Tiger and Panhandle systems; and
•an increase of $6 million from the Sea Robin pipeline due to higher rates resulting from the rate case filed in June 2019, as well as fewer third-party supply interruptions on the Sea Robin system; partially offset by
•an increase of $138 million in operating expense primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes of $126 million on the Rover pipeline system resulting from placing the final portions of this asset into service in November 2018, an increase of $24 million in transportation expense on Rover due to an increase in transportation volumes, an increase of $5 million in allocated overhead costs and additional operating expense of $4 million for assets acquired in June 2019, partially offset by lower gas imbalance and system gas activity of $15 million and lower storage capacity leased on the Panhandle system of $8 million;
•an increase of $9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in insurance expense of $8 million, an increase in employee cost of $4 million, and an increase in allocated overhead costs of $3 million, partially offset by lower Ohio excise tax on our Rover system; and 
•a decrease of $15 million in adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily resulting from a $20 million decrease due to lower earnings from MEP as a result of lower capacity being re-contracted at lower rates on expiring contracts, partially offset by a $5 million increase from our Citrus joint venture as we brought new volumes to the system in 2019.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our midstream segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $200 million in non-fee-based margin due to lower NGL prices of $183 million and lower gas prices of $50 million, offset by an increase of $33 million in non-fee-based margin due to increased throughput volume in North Texas and Permian regions; 
•an increase of $86 million in operating expenses due to increases of $33 million in outside services, $29 million in maintenance project costs, $17 million in employee costs and $6 million in office expenses and materials; and
•an increase of $9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a decrease of $5 million in capitalized overhead and an increase of $4 million in insurance expense; partially offset by
•an increase of $277 million in fee-based margin due to volume growth in the Northeast, Permian, Ark-La-Tex, North Texas and South Texas regions.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, throughput barrels on our Texas NGL pipeline system increased due to higher receipt of liquids production from both wholly-owned and third-party gas plants primarily in the Permian and North Texas regions. In addition, NGL transportation volumes on our Northeast assets increased due to the initiation of service on the Mariner East 2 pipeline system. 
Refined products transportation volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to prior year due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting supply to our refined products transportation system. These decreases in volumes are partially offset by the initiation of service on the JC Nolan Pipeline in the third quarter of 2019.
NGL and refined products terminal volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the initiation of service on our Mariner East 2 pipeline system which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Average volumes fractionated at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators in July 2018 and February 2019, respectively. 
Segment Margin. The components of our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment margin were as follows:

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $483 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $265 million increase resulting from the initiation of service on our Mariner East 2 pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2018, a $212 million increase resulting from higher throughput volumes received from the Permian region on our Texas NGL pipelines, a $29 million increase due to higher throughput volumes from the Barnett region, a $9 million increase from the Eagle Ford region, and a $9 million increase due to the initiation of service on the JC Nolan Pipeline. These increases were partially offset by a $21 million decrease resulting from Mariner East 1 pipeline downtime, a $13 million decrease due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting refined product supply to our system, and a $5 million decrease due to the timing of deficiency fees on Mariner West;
•an increase of $153 million in fractionation and refinery services margin primarily due to a $167 million increase resulting from the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators in July 2018 and February 2019, respectively, and higher NGL volumes from the Permian region feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility. This increase was partially offset by a reclassification between our fractionation and storage margins;
•an increase of $136 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $171 million increase from the initiation of service of our Mariner East 2 pipeline which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a $7 million increase due to increased tank lease revenue from third-party customers. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million decrease in volumes and expense reimbursements from third parties on Mariner East 1, a $16 million decrease due to lower volumes from third-party pipeline, truck and rail deliveries into our Marcus Hook Terminal, a $5 million decrease due to fewer vessels exported out of our Nederland Terminal, and a $4 million decrease due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019; and
•an increase of $12 million in storage margin primarily due to a reclassification between our storage and fractionation margins; partially offset by
•a decrease of $30 million in marketing margin primarily due to capacity lease fees incurred by our marketing affiliate on our Mariner East 2 pipeline, offset by increased gains from our butane blending business due to more favorable market conditions and increased volumes, as well as increased optimization gains from the sale of NGL component products at our Mont Belvieu facility;
•an increase of $52 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $26 million increase in employee and ad valorem tax expenses on our terminals, fractionation, and transportation operations, a $14 million increase in utility costs to operate our pipelines and our fifth and sixth fractionators which commenced July 2018 and February 2019, respectively, and an $8 million increase in maintenance project costs due to the timing of multiple projects on our transportation assets; and
•an increase of $19 million in general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $10 million increase in allocated overhead costs, a $5 million increase in insurance expenses, a $4 million increase in legal fees, and a $2 million increase in employee costs.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $543 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to a $282 million increase resulting from higher throughput on our Texas crude pipeline system primarily due to increased production from the Permian region and contributions from capacity expansion projects placed into service, a $219 million increase in throughput on our Bakken pipeline, a favorable change due to inventory valuation adjustment of $75 million, partially offset by a $90 million reduction due to lower pipeline basis spreads net of hedges. We also realized a $66 million increase from higher volumes on our Bayou Bridge Pipeline, a $31 million increase due to the inclusion of assets acquired in 2019, and a $26 million increase primarily from higher throughput, ship loading and tank rental fees at our Nederland Terminal; partially offset by a $54 million decrease from our Oklahoma assets resulting from lower volumes to the system as well as from the timing of a deficiency payment made in the prior year, a $12 million decrease due to the closure of a third-party refinery which was the primary customer utilizing one of our northeast crude terminals. The remainder of the offsetting decrease was primarily attributable to a change in the presentation of certain intrasegment transactions, which were eliminated in the current period presentation but were shown on a gross basis in revenues and operating expenses in the prior period; partially offset by
•an increase of $23 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $30 million increase in throughput-related costs on existing assets, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in management fees as well as the impact of certain intrasegment transactions discussed above; and
•a decrease of $7 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to lower margin from jet fuel sales by our joint ventures.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to the Investment in Sunoco LP segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease in operating costs of $76 million, primarily as a result of the conversion of 207 retail sites to commission agent sites during April 2018. These expenses include other operating expense, general and administrative expense and lease expense; and 
•an increase of $25 million related to Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations related to the divestment of 1,030 company-operated fuel sites to 7-Eleven in January 2018; and 
•an increase of $4 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to Sunoco LP’s investment in the JC Nolan joint venture; partially offset by 
•a decrease in the gross profit on motor fuel sales of $76 million (excluding the change in inventory fair value adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to lower fuel margins, a one-time benefit of approximately $25 million related to a cash settlement with a fuel supplier recorded in 2018 and an $8 million one-time charge related to a reserve for an open contractual dispute recorded in 2019, partially offset by an increase in gallons sold.

Amounts reflected in our all other segment during the periods presented above primarily include:
•our natural gas marketing operations; 
•our wholly-owned natural gas compression operations; 
•a noncontrolling interest in PES. Prior to PES’s reorganization in August 2018, ETO’s 33% interest in PES was reflected as an unconsolidated affiliate; for the period subsequent to the August 2018 reorganization through 2019, ETO held an approximately 7.4% interest in PES and no longer reflected PES as an affiliate;
•our investment in coal handling facilities; and
•our Canadian operations, which were acquired in the SemGroup acquisition in December 2019 and include natural gas gathering and processing assets.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $8 million in gains from park and loan and storage activity;
•an increase of $11 million in optimized gains on residue gas sales; 
•an increase of $7 million from settled derivatives;
•an increase of $15 million from a legal settlement;
•an increase of $12 million from payments related to the PES bankruptcy;
•an increase of $6 million from the recognition of deferred revenue related to a bankruptcy;
•an increase of $3 million from power trading activities;
•an increase of $3 million from the Energy Transfer Canada joint venture for the period subsequent to our acquisition of SemGroup on December 5, 2019, net of an increase due to SemGroup related corporate expenses; and
•a decrease of $21 million in merger and acquisition expenses; partially offset by
•a decrease of $36 million due to the contribution of CDM to USAC in April 2018, subsequent to which CDM is reflected in the Investment in USAC segment;
•a decrease of $8 million due to lower gas prices and increased power costs; and
•a decrease of $11 million due to lower revenue from our compressor equipment business.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview
Parent Company Only
Subsequent to the Energy Transfer Merger in October 2018, substantially all of the Partnership’s cash flows are derived from distributions related to its investment in ETO, whose cash flows are derived from its subsidiaries, including ETO’s investments in Sunoco LP and USAC.
The Parent Company’s primary cash requirements are for general and administrative expenses, debt service requirements and distributions to its partners. The Parent Company currently expects to fund its short-term needs for such items with cash flows from its direct and indirect investments in ETO. The Parent Company distributes its available cash remaining after satisfaction of the aforementioned cash requirements to its Unitholders on a quarterly basis.
The Parent Company expects ETO and its respective subsidiaries and investments in Sunoco LP and USAC to utilize their resources, along with cash from their operations, to fund their announced growth capital expenditures and working capital needs; however, the Parent Company may issue debt or equity securities from time to time as it deems prudent to provide liquidity for new capital projects of its subsidiaries or for other partnership purposes.
ETO
ETO’s ability to satisfy its obligations and pay distributions to the Parent Company will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business and weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of ETO’s management.
ETO currently expects capital expenditures in 2021 to be within the following ranges (excluding capital expenditures related to our investments in Sunoco LP and USAC):

                                                                                               Growth                                      Maintenance

(1)Includes capital expenditures related to ETO’s proportionate ownership of the Bakken, Rover, and Bayou Bridge pipeline projects and our proportionate ownership of the Orbit Gulf Coast NGL export project.
The assets used in our natural gas and liquids operations, including pipelines, gathering systems and related facilities, are generally long-lived assets and do not require significant maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not have any significant financial commitments for maintenance capital expenditures in our businesses. From time to time we experience increases in pipe costs due to a number of reasons, including but not limited to, delays from steel mills, limited selection of mills capable of producing large diameter pipe timely, higher steel prices and other factors beyond our control. However, we include these factors in our anticipated growth capital expenditures for each year.
ETO generally funds maintenance capital expenditures and distributions with cash flows from operating activities. ETO generally expects to funds growth capital expenditures with proceeds of borrowings under our credit facilities, along with cash from operations.
Sunoco LP expects to invest approximately $120 million in growth capital expenditures and approximately $45 million on maintenance capital expenditures in 2021. 
USAC currently plans to spend approximately $22 million in maintenance capital expenditures and currently has budgeted between $30 million and $40 million in expansion capital expenditures in 2021.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price of our products and services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, the successful integration of our acquisitions, and other factors.
Operating Activities
Changes in cash flows from operating activities between periods primarily result from changes in earnings (as discussed in “Results of Operations” above), excluding the impacts of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include recurring non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and non-cash compensation expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the periods presented primarily resulted from construction and acquisitions of assets, while changes in non-cash compensation expense resulted from changes in the number of units granted and changes in the grant date fair value estimated for such grants. Cash flows from operating activities also differ from earnings as a result of non-cash charges that may not be recurring such as impairment charges and allowance for equity funds used during construction. The allowance for equity funds used during construction increases in periods when ETO has a significant amount of interstate pipeline construction in progress. Changes in operating assets and liabilities between periods result from factors such as the changes in the value of derivative assets and liabilities, timing of accounts receivable collection, payments on accounts payable, the timing of purchases and sales of inventories, and the timing of advances and deposits received from customers.

Credit Facilities, Term Loan and Commercial Paper
Parent Company
The Parent Company does not currently have any credit facilities.
ETO Credit Facilities
Borrowings under the ETO Credit Facilities (defined as the ETO Term Loan, ETO Five-Year Credit Facility and ETO 364-Day Credit Facility, each of which is described below) are unsecured and initially guaranteed by Sunoco Logistics Operations. Borrowings under the ETO Credit Facilities will bear interest at a eurodollar rate or a base rate, at our option, plus an applicable margin. In addition, we will be required to pay a quarterly commitment fee to each lender equal to the product of the applicable rate and such lender’s applicable percentage of the unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the ETO Credit Facilities.
We typically repay amounts outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities with proceeds from unit offerings or long-term notes offerings. The timing of borrowings depends on the Partnership’s activities and the cash available to fund those activities. The repayments of amounts outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities depend on multiple factors, including market conditions and expectations of future working capital needs, and ultimately are a financing decision made by management. Therefore, the balance outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities may vary significantly between periods. We do not believe that such fluctuations indicate a significant change in our liquidity position, because we expect to continue to be able to repay amounts outstanding under the ETO Credit Facilities with proceeds from unit offerings or long-term note offerings.
ETO Term Loan
On October 17, 2019, ETO entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “ETO Term Loan”) providing for a $2.00 billion three-year term loan credit facility. Borrowings under the term loan agreement mature on October 17, 2022 and are available for working capital purposes and for general partnership purposes. The term loan agreement is unsecured and is guaranteed by our subsidiary, Sunoco Logistics Operations. 
As of December 31, 2020, the ETO Term Loan had $2.00 billion outstanding and was fully drawn. The weighted average interest rate on the total amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was 1.15%.
ETO Five-Year Credit Facility 
ETO’s revolving credit facility (the “ETO Five-Year Credit Facility”) allows for unsecured borrowings up to $5.00 billion and matures on December 1, 2023. The ETO Five-Year Credit Facility contains an accordion feature, under which the total aggregate commitment may be increased up to $6.00 billion under certain conditions. 
As of December 31, 2020, the ETO Five-Year Credit Facility had $3.10 billion outstanding, of which $1.66 billion was commercial paper. The amount available for future borrowings was $1.79 billion after accounting for outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $109 million. The weighted average interest rate on the total amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was 1.12%.
ETO 364-Day Facility

The term loan facility and the revolving credit facility mature on February 25, 2024. The KAPS Facility matures on June 13, 2024. Energy Transfer Canada may incur additional term loans and revolving commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed C$250 million (US$196 million at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate), subject to receiving commitments for such additional term loans or revolving commitments from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. 
Covenants Related to Our Credit Agreements
Covenants Related to the Parent Company
The Term Loan Facility and ET Revolving Credit Facility previously contained customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default, including a change of control event of default and limitations on incurrence of liens, new lines of business, merger, transactions with affiliates and restrictive agreements. Both facilities have been paid off and terminated.
Covenants Related to ETO

The ETO Credit Facilities also limit us, on a rolling four quarter basis, to a maximum Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as defined in the underlying credit agreements, of 
5.0 to 1, which can generally be increased to 5.5 to 1 during a Specified Acquisition Period. Our Leverage Ratio was 4.31 to 1 at December 31, 2020, as calculated in accordance with the credit agreements. 
The agreements relating to the Transwestern senior notes contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional debt, the sale of assets and the payment of dividends and specify a maximum debt to capitalization ratio. 
Failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of our revolving credit facilities could require us to pay debt balances prior to scheduled maturity and could negatively impact the Partnership’s or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt and/or our ability to pay distributions to Unitholders.
Covenants Related to Panhandle 
Panhandle is not party to any lending agreement that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation due to a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, nor would a reduction in any credit rating, by itself, cause an event of default under any of Panhandle’s lending agreements. 
Panhandle’s restrictive covenants include restrictions on liens securing debt and guarantees and restrictions on mergers and on the sales of assets. A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of Panhandle’s debt.
Covenants Related to Sunoco LP
The Sunoco LP Credit Facility contains various customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including a change of control event of default, as defined therein. Sunoco LP’s Credit Facility requires Sunoco LP to maintain a Net Leverage Ratio of not more than 5.5 to 1. The maximum Net Leverage Ratio is subject to upwards adjustment of not more than 6.0 to 1 for a period not to exceed three fiscal quarters in the event Sunoco LP engages in certain specified acquisitions of not less than $50 million (as permitted under Sunoco LP’s Credit Facility agreement). The Sunoco LP Credit Facility also requires Sunoco LP to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Sunoco LP’s Credit Facility agreement) of not less than 2.25 to 1. 
Covenants Related to USAC 
The USAC Credit Facility contains covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) USAC’s ability to, among other things:
•grant liens; 
•make certain loans or investments; 
•incur additional indebtedness or guarantee other indebtedness; 
•merge or consolidate; 
•sell our assets; or 
•make certain acquisitions. 
The credit facility is also subject to the following financial covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain: 
•a minimum EBITDA to interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0, determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and 
•a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio, determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, for the annualized trailing three months of (i) 5.75 to 1 through the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2020 and (ii) 5.5 to 1 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, (iii) 5.25 to 1 for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021 and (iv) 5.0 to 1 thereafter, subject to a provision for increases to such thresholds, in the case of any fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021 or thereafter, by 0.50 in connection with certain future acquisitions for the six consecutive month period following the period in which any such acquisition occurs, provided that, in any event, such ratio shall not exceed 5.5 to 1.
Covenants Related to the HFOTCO Tax Exempt Notes 
The indentures covering HFOTCO's tax exempt notes due 2050 ("IKE Bonds") include customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants include limitations on the creation of new liens, indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments and payments on indebtedness, making certain dispositions, making material changes in business activities, making fundamental changes including liquidations, mergers or consolidations, making certain investments, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, making amendments to certain credit or organizational agreements, modifying the fiscal year, creating or dealing with hazardous materials in certain ways, entering into certain 
hedging arrangements, entering into certain restrictive agreements, funding or engaging in sanctioned activities, taking actions or causing the trustee to take actions that materially adversely affect the rights, interests, remedies or security of the bondholders, taking actions to remove the trustee, making certain amendments to the bond documents, and taking actions or omitting to take actions that adversely impact the tax exempt status of the IKE Bonds.

(1)Interest payments on long-term debt are based on the principal amount of debt obligations as of December 31, 2020. With respect to variable rate debt, the interest payments were estimated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2020. To the extent interest rates change, our contractual obligations for interest payments will change. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion.
(2)We define a purchase commitment as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for refined product and energy commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. Our estimated future variable price contract payment obligations are based on the December 31, 2020 market price of the applicable commodity applied to future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are established at the inception of the contract. Our estimated future fixed price contract payment obligations are based on the contracted fixed price under each commodity contract. Obligations shown in the table represent estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated.
(3)Includes minimum guaranteed payments under service concession arrangements with New Jersey Turnpike Authority and New York Thruway Authority.
(4)Expected contributions to fund our pension and postretirement benefit plans were included in “Other” above. Environmental liabilities, AROs, unrecognized tax benefits, contingency accruals and deferred revenue, which were included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets, were excluded from the table above as the amounts do not represent contractual obligations or, in some cases, the amount and/or timing of the cash payments is uncertain.
(5)Excludes non-current deferred tax liabilities of $3.43 billion due to uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows for such liabilities.

Sunoco LP Cash Distributions
The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus between Sunoco LP’s common unitholders and the holder of its IDRs based on the specified target distribution levels, after the payment of distributions to Class C unitholders. The amounts set forth under “marginal percentage interest in distributions” are the percentage interests of the IDR holder and the common unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus which Sunoco LP distributes up to and including the corresponding amount in the column “total quarterly distribution per unit target amount.” 
The percentage interests shown for common unitholders and IDR holder for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution.

                                                                                                                     Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions

Critical Accounting Estimates
The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules, and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. For further details on our accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the accrual for and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The natural gas industry conducts its business by processing actual transactions at the end of the month following the month of delivery. Consequently, the most current month’s financial results for the midstream, NGL and intrastate transportation and storage segments are estimated using volume estimates and market prices. Any differences between estimated results and actual results are recognized in the following month’s financial statements. Management believes that the operating results estimated for the year ended December 31, 2020 represent the actual results in all material respects.
Some of the other significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the timing of certain forecasted transactions that are hedged, the fair value of derivative instruments, useful lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization, purchase accounting allocations and subsequent realizability of intangible assets, fair value measurements used in the goodwill impairment test, market value of inventory, assets and liabilities resulting from the regulated ratemaking process, contingency reserves and environmental reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired. An impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is recognized when circumstances indicate that a decline in the investment value is 
other than temporary. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset/goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. 
In order to test for recoverability when performing a quantitative impairment test, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, we make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located, the availability and prices of natural gas, our ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements, the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful, our dependence on certain significant customers and producers of natural gas, and competition from other companies, including major energy producers. While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to calculate the fair value, if future results are not consistent with our estimates, we could be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
The Partnership determines the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow method, the guideline company method, or a weighted combination of these methods. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. The Partnership believes the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, the Partnership determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit including estimates for capital expenditures, discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted industry rate, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit. Cash flow projections are derived from one year budgeted amounts and five year operating forecasts plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur. Under the guideline company method, the Partnership determines the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using a three year average. In addition, the Partnership estimates a reasonable control premium, when appropriate, representing the incremental value that accrues to the majority owner from the opportunity to dictate the strategic and operational actions of the business.
One key assumption for the measurement of an impairment is management’s estimate of future cash flows and EBITDA. These estimates are based on the annual budget for the upcoming year and forecasted amounts for multiple subsequent years. The annual budget process is typically completed near the annual goodwill impairment testing date, and management uses the most recent information for the annual impairment tests. The forecast is also subjected to a comprehensive update annually in conjunction with the annual budget process and is revised periodically to reflect new information and/or revised expectations. The estimates of future cash flows and EBITDA are subjective in nature and are subject to impacts from the business risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period. Such changes in fair value estimates could result in additional impairments in future periods; therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period, resulting in additional impairments. 
In addition, we may change our method of impairment testing, including changing the weight assigned to different valuation models. Such changes could be driven by various factors, including the level of precision or availability of data for our assumptions. Any changes in the method of testing could also result in an impairment or impact the magnitude of an impairment.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership recorded impairments totaling $3.01 billion, $74 million and $431 million, respectively, including $129 million in impairments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2020, and $66 million, $53 million and $52 million of long-lived asset impairments in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additional information on the impairments recorded during these periods is available in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
The goodwill impairments recorded by the Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 represented all of the goodwill within the respective reporting units.
Management does not believe that any of the Partnership’s goodwill balances, long-lived assets or investments in unconsolidated affiliates is currently at significant risk of a material impairment; however, of the $2.39 billion of goodwill on 
the Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, approximately $368 million is recorded in reporting units for which the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 20% in the most recent quantitative test.
Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets. Depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets is provided using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives. Changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on our results of operation. The Partnership’s results of operations have not been significantly impacted by changes in the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets during the periods presented, and we do not anticipate any such significant changes in the future. However, changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to change the estimated useful lives of the assets, which could significantly impact the Partnership’s results of operations. Additional information on our accounting policies and the estimated useful lives associated with our long-lived assets is available in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Legal and Regulatory Matters. We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from claims, orders, judgments or settlements. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. We expense legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are revised, as required, as better information becomes available to us. The factors we consider when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of our legal counsel; (ii) our previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accruals of $77 million and $120 million, respectively, were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets related to these contingent obligations.
For more information on our litigation and contingencies, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this report.
Environmental Remediation Activities. The Partnership’s accrual for environmental remediation activities reflects anticipated work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The accrual for known claims is undiscounted and is based on currently available information, estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. It is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations, changing technologies and their associated costs, and changes in the economic environment. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities. 
Losses attributable to unasserted claims are generally reflected in the accruals on an undiscounted basis, to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We have established a wholly-owned captive insurance company to bear certain risks associated with environmental obligations related to certain sites that are no longer operating. The premiums paid to the captive insurance company include estimates for environmental claims that have been incurred but not reported, based on an actuarially determined fully developed claims expense estimate. In such cases, we accrue losses attributable to unasserted claims based on the discounted estimates that are used to develop the premiums paid to the captive insurance company.
In general, each remediation site/issue is evaluated individually based upon information available for the site/issue and no pooling or statistical analysis is used to evaluate an aggregate risk for a group of similar items (e.g., service station sites) in determining the amount of probable loss accrual to be recorded. The Partnership’s estimates of environmental remediation costs also frequently involve evaluation of a range of estimates. In many cases, it is difficult to determine that one point in the range of loss estimates is more likely than any other. In these situations, existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued. Accordingly, the low end of the range often represents the amount of loss which has been recorded. The Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet reflected $306 million and $320 million in environmental accruals as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon, among other things, the identification of any additional sites, the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site, the timing and nature of required remedial actions, the nature of operations at each site, the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements, the nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the availability of insurance coverage, the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations, inflation rates, terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of the Partnership’s liability at the sites, if any, in light of the number, participation level and financial viability of the other parties. The recognition of additional losses, if and when they were to occur, would likely extend over many years. Management believes that the Partnership’s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material. However, if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur or the assumptions used to estimate losses at multiple sites are adjusted, such changes could impact 
multiple facilities, formerly owned facilities and third-party sites at the same time. As a result, from time to time, significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur; however, management does not believe that any such charges would have a material adverse impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial position.
Deferred Income Taxes. ET recognizes benefits in earnings and related deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and tax credit carryforwards. If necessary, a charge to earnings and a related valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized by the Partnership in the future. Deferred income tax assets attributable to state and federal NOLs and federal excess business interest expense carryforwards totaling $1.047 billion have been included in ET’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The state NOL carryforward benefits of $220 million ($174 million net of federal benefit) begin to expire in 2021 with a substantial portion expiring between 2033 and 2039. ET’s corporate subsidiaries have federal NOLs of $3.73 billion ($784 million in benefits) of which $1.3 billion will expire between 2031 and 2037. A total of $787 million of the federal net operating loss carryforward is limited under IRC §382. Although we expect to fully utilize the IRC §382 limited federal net operating loss, the amount utilized in a particular year may be limited. Any federal NOL generated in 2018 and future years can be carried forward indefinitely. We have determined that a valuation allowance totaling $113 million ($89 million net of federal income tax effects) is required for state NOLs as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to significant restrictions on their use in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A separate valuation allowance of $45 million is attributable to foreign tax credits. In making the assessment of the future realization of the deferred tax assets, we rely on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income based on historical and projected future operating results. The potential need for valuation allowances is regularly reviewed by management. If it is more likely than not that the recorded asset will not be realized, additional valuation allowances which increase income tax expense may be recognized in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made.

You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. When considering forward-looking statements, please review the risks described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this annual report. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
Inflation
Interest rates on existing and future credit facilities and future debt offerings could be significantly higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Although increased financing costs could limit our ability to raise funds in the capital markets, we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects since our competitors would face similar circumstances.
Inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and has not had a material effect on our results of operations. It may in the future, however, increase the cost to acquire or replace property, plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies. Our operating revenues and costs are influenced to a greater extent by commodity price 
changes. To the extent permitted by competition, regulation and our existing agreements, we have and will continue to pass along a portion of increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees.
