ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Tabular dollar and unit amounts, except per unit data, are in millions)
Energy Transfer LP is a Delaware limited partnership whose common units are publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ET.”
The following discussion of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Partnership” and “Energy Transfer” mean Energy Transfer LP and its consolidated subsidiaries.
OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer directly and indirectly owns equity interests in Sunoco LP and USAC, which are limited partnerships engaged in diversified energy-related services. Sunoco LP and USAC have publicly traded common units. 
Energy Transfer derives cash flows from distributions related to its investment in its subsidiaries, including Sunoco LP and USAC. The amount of cash that Sunoco LP and USAC distribute to their respective partners, including Energy Transfer, each quarter is based on earnings from their respective business activities and the amount of available cash, as discussed below.
The primary activities in which we are engaged, which are in the United States and Canada, and the operating subsidiaries through which we conduct those activities are as follows:
•natural gas operations, including the following: 
•natural gas midstream and intrastate transportation and storage; 
•interstate natural gas transportation and storage; and 
•crude oil, NGL and refined products transportation, terminalling services and acquisition and marketing activities, as well as NGL storage and fractionation services.
In addition, we own investments in other businesses, including Sunoco LP and USAC, both of which are publicly traded master limited partnerships.
Energy Transfer derives cash flows from distributions related to its investment in its subsidiaries, including Sunoco LP and USAC. Energy Transfer’s primary cash requirements are for distributions to its partners, general and administrative expenses and debt service requirements. Energy Transfer distributes its available cash remaining after satisfaction of the aforementioned cash requirements to its Unitholders on a quarterly basis.
We expect our subsidiaries to utilize their resources, along with cash from their operations, to fund their announced growth capital expenditures and working capital needs; however, Energy Transfer may issue debt or equity securities from time to time as we deem prudent to provide liquidity for new capital projects of our subsidiaries or for other partnership purposes.
General
Our primary objective is to increase the level of our distributable cash flow to our Unitholders over time by pursuing a business strategy that is currently focused on growing our subsidiaries’ natural gas and liquids businesses through, among other things, pursuing certain construction and expansion opportunities relating to our subsidiaries’ existing infrastructure and acquiring certain strategic operations and businesses or assets. The actual amounts of cash that we will have available for distribution will primarily depend on the amount of cash our subsidiaries generate from their operations.
Our reportable segments are as follows:
•intrastate transportation and storage;
•interstate transportation and storage;
•midstream;
•NGL and refined products transportation and services;
•crude oil transportation and services;
•investment in Sunoco LP;
•investment in USAC; and
•all other.
Recent Developments
Energy Transfer and ETO Rollup Mergers
On April 1, 2021, Energy Transfer, ETO and certain of ETO’s subsidiaries consummated several internal reorganization transactions (the “Rollup Mergers”). In connection with the Rollup Mergers, ETO merged with and into Energy Transfer, with Energy Transfer surviving. The impacts of the Rollup Mergers also included the following:
•All of ETO’s long-term debt was assumed by Energy Transfer, as more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”.
•Each issued and outstanding ETO preferred unit was converted into the right to receive one newly created Energy Transfer preferred unit. A description of the Energy Transfer Preferred Units is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
•Each of ETO’s issued and outstanding Class K, Class L, Class M and Class N units were converted into an aggregate 675,625,000 newly created Class B Units representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer. All of the Class B Units are held by ETP Holdco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer.
Series H Preferred Units Issuance
On June 15, 2021, the Partnership issued 900,000 of its 6.500% Series H Preferred Units at a price of $1,000 per unit. The net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Partnership’s term loan and for general partnership purposes.
Winter Storm Impacts
Winter Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021, resulted in one-time impacts to the Partnership’s consolidated net income and Adjusted EBITDA and also affected the results of operations in certain segments, as discussed in “Results of Operations”. The recognition of the impacts of Winter Storm Uri during the year ended December 31, 2021 required management to make certain estimates and assumptions, including estimates of expected credit losses and assumptions related to the resolution of disputes with counterparties with respect to certain purchases and sales of natural gas. The ultimate realization of credit losses and the resolution of disputed purchases and sales of natural gas could materially impact the Partnership’s financial condition and results of operations in future periods.
Enable Acquisition
On December 2, 2021, the Partnership completed the previously announced merger with Enable (the “Enable Acquisition”). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Enable’s common unitholders received 0.8595 of an Energy Transfer common unit in exchange for each Enable common unit. In addition, each outstanding Enable Series A preferred unit was exchanged for 0.0265 of an Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Unit. A total of 384,780 Series G Preferred Units were issued in connection with the Enable Acquisition. The total fair value of Energy Transfer common units and Series G Preferred Units issued was approximately $3.5 billion at the closing date. Energy Transfer also made a $10 million cash payment for Enable’s general partner.
In connection with the Enable Acquisition on December 2, 2021, Energy Transfer repaid $800 million outstanding on the Enable 2019 Term Loan Agreement and $35 million outstanding on the Enable Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, and both facilities were terminated. In addition, the Partnership assumed $3.18 billion aggregate principal amount of Enable senior notes.
Regulatory Update
Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Regulation
Rate Regulation
Effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related proposals, the FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. The FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. The FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that the FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership would not “double recover” its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost of service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. On July 18, 2018, the FERC clarified that a pipeline 
organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors’ income tax costs. On July 31, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC’s decision denying a separate master limited partnership recovery of an income tax allowance and its decision not to require the master limited partnership to refund accumulated deferred income tax balances. In light of the rehearing order’s clarification regarding an individual entity’s ability to argue in support of recovery of an income tax allowance and the court’s subsequent opinion upholding denial of an income tax allowance to a master limited partnership, the impact of the FERC’s policy on the treatment of income taxes on the rates we can charge for FERC-regulated transportation services is unknown at this time. 
Even without application of the FERC’s recent rate making-related policy statements and rulemakings, the FERC or our shippers may challenge the cost-of-service rates we charge. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many components, including ROE and tax-related components, but also other pipeline costs that will continue to affect FERC’s determination of just and reasonable cost of service rates. Moreover, we receive revenues from our pipelines based on a variety of rate structures, including cost-of-service rates, negotiated rates, discounted rates and market-based rates. Many of our interstate pipelines, such as ETC Tiger, Midcontinent Express and Fayetteville Express, have negotiated market rates that were agreed to by customers in connection with long-term contracts entered into to support the construction of the pipelines. Other systems, such as FGT, Transwestern and Panhandle, have a mix of tariff rate, discount rate, and negotiated rate agreements. The revenues we receive from natural gas transportation services we provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates may decrease in the future as a result of changes to FERC policies, combined with the reduced corporate federal income tax rate established in the Tax Act. The extent of any revenue reduction related to our cost-of-service rates, if any, will depend on a detailed review of all of our cost-of-service components and the outcomes of any challenges to our rates by the FERC or our shippers.
On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a final rule establishing procedures to evaluate rates charged by the FERC-jurisdictional gas pipelines in light of the Tax Act and the FERC’s Revised Policy Statement. By the Order issued January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle’s existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether the rates currently charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing. On August 30, 2019, Panhandle filed a general rate proceeding under Section 4 of the NGA. The Natural Gas Act Section 5 and Section 4 proceedings were consolidated by order of the Chief Judge on October 1, 2019. A hearing in the combined proceedings commenced on August 25, 2020 and adjourned on September 15, 2020. The initial decision by the administrative law judge was issued on March 26, 2021. On April 26, 2021, Panhandle filed its brief on exceptions to the initial decision. On May 17, 2021, Panhandle filed its brief opposing exceptions in this proceeding. This matter remains pending before the FERC.
Pipeline Certification
The FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 (“Pipeline Certification NOI”), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. On February 18, 2021, the FERC issued another NOI (“2021 NOI”), reopening its review of the 1999 Policy Statement. Comments on the 2021 NOI were due on May 26, 2021; we filed comments in the FERC proceeding. In September 2021, FERC issued a Notice of Technical Conference on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation related to natural gas infrastructure projects authorized under Sections 3 and 7 of the Natural Gas Act. A technical conference was held on November 19, 2021, and post-technical conference comments were submitted to the FERC on January 7, 2022. The FERC has not taken any further action regarding the 2018 NOI, 2021 NOI, or Technical Conference on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation, and we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the NOIs or following the technical conference that might affect our natural gas pipeline or LNG facility operations, or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.
Interstate Common Carrier Regulation
The FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPI-FG. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC liquids index to change transportation rates annually. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. The FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. In a December 2020 order, FERC determined that during the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, common carriers charging indexed rates will be permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG plus 0.78 percent. The Commission received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order and on January 20, 2022, granted rehearing and modified the oil index. Specifically, for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, liquids pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price 
Index minus 0.21%. FERC directed liquids pipelines to recompute their ceiling levels for July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 based on the new index level. Where an oil pipeline’s filed rates exceed its ceiling levels, FERC ordered such oil pipelines to reduce the rate to bring it into compliance with the recomputed ceiling level to be effective March 1, 2022. 
Trends and Outlook
Recent market disruptions involving the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted our earnings and cash flows from operations and may continue to do so. Demand for natural gas, NGLs, refined products and/or crude oil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has generally trended toward a recovery since the lows experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. However, recent variants of COVID-19 have continued to cause market disruptions and earnings volatility in 2021. Any future variants or resurgence of existing variants could result in decreased volumes transported on our pipeline systems and decreased overall utilization of our midstream services.
With respect to commodity prices, the outlook is mixed and could have a varying impact on our business. Crude oil prices have seen significant recovery recently; however, global supply uncertainty has kept the forward curve in steep backwardation. Additionally, the market continues to be impacted by heightened levels of demand uncertainty as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the future impacts, or the duration of such impacts, resulting from COVID-19.
Natural gas prices have also strengthened over the past year. Uncertainty about winter weather, particularly in Texas, has supported opportunity on our intrastate transportation and storage assets. In addition, high European natural gas prices have increased demand for LNG exports from the U.S., which has further helped to support prices. The overall outlook for our midstream services will depend, in part, on the timing and extent of recovery in the commodity markets.
While we anticipate that current and projected commodity prices and the related impact to activity levels in both the upstream and midstream sectors will impact our business, we cannot predict the ultimate magnitude of that impact and expect it to be varied across our operations, depending on the region, customer, type of service, contract term and other factors.
While the vast majority of our revenues are from counterparties that are investment grade rated companies, recent market disruptions increased the likelihood that some of our counterparties may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. However, we believe that the recent increases in commodity prices, along with recent expense-cutting initiatives by many companies, have generally strengthened the credit profile for the majority of our producer counterparties.
Ultimately, the extent to which our business will be impacted by recent market developments depends on the factors described above as well as future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In response to the recent market volatility and uncertainties, we reduced growth capital spending over the last two years, and we expect to continue to a lower level of growth capital spending going forward. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our capital expenditures over the last three years and our forecasted capital expenditures for 2022. 
Regarding the recently completed Enable acquisition, the transaction closed in December 2021; therefore, our consolidated results for 2021 only reflect one month of activity from Enable’s business. We expect that the combined operations will favorably impact our results going forward, primarily impacting our natural gas businesses.
We currently have ample liquidity to fund our business, and we do not anticipate any liquidity concerns in the immediate future (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below). In addition, we continue to have access to the debt capital markets on generally favorable terms. In the event we seek additional equity or debt capital, our blended cost of capital for equity and debt is expected to be modestly higher in the near term; however, we will continue to evaluate growth projects and acquisitions as such opportunities may be identified in the future in light of this higher cost of capital.
In addition to the trends and outlook discussed above with respect to the Partnership’s existing business and finances, we also anticipate that the Partnership will continue to increase its focus on the development of alternative energy projects. The Partnership has announced several such projects recently and will continue to pursues opportunities aimed at continuing to reduce its environmental footprint throughout its operations. 
Results of Operations
We report Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as measures of segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as total Partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, inventory valuation adjustments, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts for unconsolidated affiliates based on the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in earnings of 
unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates. The use of Segment Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates as an analytical tool should be limited accordingly. 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as reported for each segment in the table below, is analyzed for each segment in the section titled “Segment Operating Results.” Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of the Partnership’s fundamental business activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP measures.

Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased 24%, primarily due to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. The most significant impacts from the storm were recognized in our intrastate transportation and storage segment, where realized storage margin increased by $1.5 billion compared to the prior period as a result of withdrawals during the storm. In addition, realized natural gas sales increased $950 million and retained fuel revenues increased $132 million in our intrastate transportation and storage segment, and these increases were also primarily due to the impacts of the storm. 
The change in Adjusted EBITDA also reflected the impacts of non-storm-related factors among all of the Partnership’s reportable segments. In our crude oil transportation and services segment, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $235 million primarily due to lower average tariff rates realized on our Texas crude pipeline system, as well as a decrease from our crude oil acquisition and marketing business. In our interstate transportation and storage segment, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 
$165 million primarily due to shipper contract expirations and a recent shipper bankruptcy. In our midstream segment, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $198 million primarily due to favorable NGL and natural gas prices.
Additional information on changes impacting Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, including other impacts from Winter Storm Uri and other non-storm-related factors, is available below in “Segment Operating Results.”
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, decreased primarily due to the following:
•interest expense recognized by the Partnership (excluding Sunoco LP and USAC) decreased by $51 million due to lower aggregate debt and lower interest rates on refinanced debt, partially offset by lower capitalized interest;
•an increase of $1 million recognized by USAC was primarily due to increased borrowings under its credit agreement and increased amortization of debt issuance costs related to the amendment and restatement of its credit agreement in the current period, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates under the credit agreement; and
•a decrease of $12 million recognized by Sunoco LP due to a slight decrease in average total long-term debt and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on long-term debt for the respective periods.
Impairment Losses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, impairment losses included fixed asset impairments of $5 million recognized by USAC related to its compression equipment and $10 million recognized by Energy Transfer Canada related to a processing plant, as well as a $6 million impairment of intangible assets related to customer contracts within the Partnership’s crude operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments totaling $2.2 billion and fixed asset impairments totaling $58 million, primarily due to decreases in projected future cash flows as a result of overall market demand decline. In addition, USAC recognized a goodwill impairment of $619 million as well as an equipment impairment of $8 million based on changes in market conditions.
Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Gains on interest rate derivatives increased by $264 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in forward swap rates.
Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation adjustments represent changes in lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method on Sunoco LP’s inventory. These amounts are unrealized valuation adjustments applied to fuel volumes remaining in inventory at the end of the period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase in fuel prices reduced lower of cost or market reserve requirements for the period by $190 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, a decline in fuel prices increased lower of cost or market reserve requirements for the period by $82 million, resulting in an adverse impact to net income.
Losses on Extinguishments of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the losses on extinguishments of debt included amounts related to Sunoco LP’s repurchase of its 2026 senior notes in 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the losses on extinguishments of debt included amounts related to the Senior Note redemption in January 2020. In addition, Sunoco LP recognized a $13 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of its outstanding 2023 senior notes in 2020.
Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliate. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recorded an impairment to its investment in White Cliffs of $129 million due to a decrease in projected future revenues and cash flows as a result of the overall market demand decline that occurred subsequent to the SemGroup acquisition and related purchase price allocation in December 2019.

Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period last year, income tax expense decreased due to recognition of a favorable valuation allowance adjustment for state net operating losses and a state tax rate change in the current period.

(1)For the year ended December 31, 2020, equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates includes the impact of non-cash impairments recorded by FEP, which reduced the Partnership’s equity in earnings by $208 million.
(2)These amounts represent our proportionate share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our unconsolidated affiliates and are based on our equity in earnings or losses of our unconsolidated affiliates adjusted for our proportionate share of the unconsolidated affiliates’ interest, depreciation, depletion, amortization, non-cash items and taxes.
Segment Operating Results
We evaluate segment performance based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is one of the performance measures used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments.
The tables below identify the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as follows:
•Segment margin, operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts represent the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements that are attributable to each segment. 
•Unrealized gains or losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments. These are the unrealized amounts that are included in cost of products sold to calculate segment margin. These amounts are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, the unrealized losses are added back and the unrealized gains are subtracted to calculate the segment measure. 
•Non-cash compensation expense. These amounts represent the total non-cash compensation recorded in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses related to equity awards. This expense is not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and therefore is added back to calculate the segment measure. 
•Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates.
In the following analysis of segment operating results, a measure of segment margin is reported for segments with sales revenues. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented. 
In addition, for certain segments, the sections below include information on the components of segment margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of segment margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin, and other margin. These components of segment margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of segment margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. 
Winter Storm Impacts
Winter Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021, resulted in one-time impacts to the Partnership’s Adjusted EBITDA and also affected the results of operations in certain segments. The recognition of the impacts of Winter Storm Uri during the year ended December 31, 2021 required management to make certain estimates and assumptions, including estimates of expected credit losses and assumptions related to the resolution of disputes with counterparties with respect to certain purchases and sales of natural gas. The ultimate realization of credit losses and the resolution of disputed purchases and sales of natural gas could materially impact the Partnership’s financial condition and results of operations in future periods.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $1.51 billion in realized storage margin due to higher physical storage margin from withdrawals during Winter Storm Uri;
•an increase $950 million of in realized natural gas sales and other primarily due to natural gas sales during Winter Storm Uri;
•an increase of $132 million in retained fuel revenues primarily due to higher natural gas sales during Winter Storm Uri; and
•an increase of $123 million in transportation fees due to a $67 million increase in revenues from Winter Storm Uri, a $53 million increase from demand volume ramp-ups from the Permian, and a $16 million in incremental revenue from the Enable assets acquired in December 2021, partially offset by the expiration of certain contracts on Regency Intrastate Gas System; partially offset by
•an increase of $91 million in operating expenses primarily due to increases of $56 million in cost of fuel consumption, mostly during Winter Storm Uri, $15 million in maintenance project costs, $8 million in employee relate costs, $5 million in ad valorem taxes, $4 million in outside services and material costs, and $3 million in incremental expenses from operation of the Enable assets acquired in December 2021.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, transported volumes decreased primarily due to foundation shipper contract expirations and a shipper bankruptcy on our Tiger system and lower utilization of contracted capacity on our Trunkline system, partially offset by the impact of the Enable Acquisition.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $31 million in segment margin primarily due to a $127 million decrease resulting from shipper contract expirations on our Tiger system, a $55 million decrease due to a shipper bankruptcy during 2020 also on our Tiger system, and a $36 million decrease on our Panhandle and Trunkline systems due to lower demand. These decreases were partially offset by a $100 million increase in operational gas sales, a $50 million increase in transportation revenues from our Rover, Transwestern and Tiger systems due to increased demand and a $39 million increase due to the impact of the Enable Acquisition;
•an increase of $13 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $16 million increase due to the impact of the Enable Acquisition, a $20 million increase in ad valorem taxes due to refunds received in 2020 on Transwestern, a $17 million increase in employee related costs and a $14 million increase from the revaluation of system gas. These increases were partially offset by a $39 million decrease due to bad debt expense recorded in the prior period, a $7 million decrease in transportation expense and a $6 million decrease resulting from an inventory valuation adjustment in the prior period;
•an increase of $24 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $13 million impact resulting from a settlement related to excise taxes on Rover in the prior period and a $13 million increase in allocated overhead costs. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in professional fees; and
•a decrease of $104 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to a $75 million decrease from our Fayetteville Express Pipeline joint venture as a result of the expiration of foundation shipper contracts, a $21 million decrease from our Citrus joint venture due to a contractual rate adjustment and higher project expenses and a $10 million decrease from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline joint venture due to capacity sold at lower rates; partially offset by
•an increase of $7 million in other Adjusted EBITDA primarily due to certain one-time fees received in connection with the operation of a joint venture.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, NGL transportation volumes increased primarily due to the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export pipelines into our Nederland Terminal in the fourth quarter of 2020, higher volumes from the Eagle Ford region and higher volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes caused by production interruptions, primarily in the Permian region, due to Winter Storm Uri during the first quarter of 2021.
Refined products transportation volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to prior year due to recovery from COVID-19 related demand reduction in the prior period.
NGL and refined products terminal volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to the previously mentioned start of new pipelines and refined product demand recovery.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, average fractionated volumes at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility reflected lower NGL volumes feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility as a result of production interruptions, primarily in the Permian region, due to Winter Storm Uri during the first quarter of 2021; however, this reduction was substantially offset by impact from the commissioning of our seventh fractionator in February 2020.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $121 million in transportation margin due to a $105 million increase due to higher export volumes feeding into our Nederland Terminal, a $40 million increase from higher throughput on our Mariner pipeline systems, a $35 million 
intrasegment gain related to cavern withdrawals which is offset in our fractionators margin, intrasegment capacity lease revenues of $25 million which are fully offset by a charge reflected in our marketing margin and an $18 million increase in refined products transportation due primarily to recovery from COVID-19 related demand reduction in the prior period. These increases were partially offset by an $88 million decrease resulting from increased utilization of our ethane optimization strategy and a $10 million decrease from volumetric losses on our Texas y-grade pipeline system;
•an increase of $101 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $130 million increase from fees for loading export cargos at our Nederland Terminal, a $9 million increase due to higher throughput and storage at our refined product terminals due to recovery from COVID-19 related demand reduction in the prior period and other refined products demand increases and a $5 million increase due to higher throughput at our Marcus Hook Terminal. These increases were partially offset by a $44 million decrease resulting from an expiration of a third-party contract at our Nederland Terminal in the second quarter of 2020; 
•an increase of $21 million in storage margin primarily due to a $31 million increase in fees generated from exported volumes and a $7 million increase in blending activity due to a more favorable pricing environment. These increases were partially offset by a $19 million decrease from component product storage fees; and
•an increase of $15 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to a $10 million increase primarily resulting from higher throughput on Explorer pipeline due to COVID-19 demand recovery and a $4 million increase from higher volumes on White Cliffs pipeline; partially offset by
•an increase of $134 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $74 million increase in utilities costs resulting from increased gas and power costs, a $32 million increase in employee costs resulting primarily from corporate cost reductions in 2020 in response to the COVID pandemic, a $20 million increase in allocated corporate overhead costs and a $7 million increase due to the timing of maintenance related expenses;
•a decrease of $56 million in marketing margin primarily due to a $29 million decrease from the optimization of NGL component products from our Gulf Coast NGL activities, intrasegment charges of $25 million which are fully offset within our transportation margin and a $3 million decrease from our northeast blending and optimization activity;
•an increase of $30 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to corporate cost reductions in 2020; and
•a decrease of $14 million in fractionators and refinery services margin primarily due to a $35 million intrasegment charge related to cavern withdrawals which is offset in our transportation margin and a $32 million decrease resulting from increased utilization of our ethane optimization strategy. These decreases were partially offset by a $37 million increase due to a more favorable pricing environment impacting our refinery services business and a $16 million increase from operational blending.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, crude transportation volumes were higher on our Bakken pipeline and Bayou Bridge pipelines, reflecting the continuing recovery in crude oil production in North Dakota and more favorable crude oil differentials for shippers on Bayou Bridge. Volumes on our Texas pipeline system were slightly lower, 
primarily reflecting adverse weather negatively impacting volumes in the first quarter of 2021 and less favorable spreads for shippers to some markets in 2021. Crude terminal volumes were lower primarily due to reduced export demand at our Gulf Coast terminals.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $170 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to a $167 million decrease from our Texas crude pipeline system due to lower average tariff rates realized, a $95 million decrease from our crude oil acquisition and marketing business primarily due to storage trading gains realized in the prior period and less favorable pricing conditions impacting our Bakken to Gulf Coast trading operations partially offset by favorable crude inventory valuation adjustments, and a $33 million decrease in throughput at our crude terminals primarily driven by reduced export demand; partially offset by a $6 million increase related to assets acquired in 2021, a $27 million increase due to higher volumes on our Bayou Bridge pipeline and a $95 million increase due to higher volumes on our Bakken Pipeline; and
•an increase of $21 million operating expenses primarily due to higher volume-driven expenses, higher employee expenses, and expenses related to assets acquired in 2021; and
•an increase of $17 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher allocations to the crude segment as a result of assets acquired, partially offset by lower legal expenses; and
•a decrease of $18 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to lower volumes on White Cliffs pipeline from lower crude oil production, partially offset by higher jet fuel sales by our joint ventures.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our investment in USAC segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $34 million in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in average revenue generating horsepower resulting from returns of compression units from its customers which USAC believes is primarily due to continued optimization of existing compression service requirements by USAC’s customers, partially offset by compression units moving from standby to full billing rate since the previous periods; partially offset by
•a decrease of $15 million operating expenses was primarily due to an $8 million decrease in direct labor expenses and a $5 million decrease in non-income taxes, primarily due to sales tax refunds received in the current period related to prior periods, and
•a decrease of $10 million in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to a $6 million decrease in the provision for expected credit losses, a $2 million decrease in employee-related expenses and a $2 million decrease in severance charges primarily due to the departure of one of our executives during the prior period.

•our investment in coal handling facilities; and
•our Canadian operations, which include natural gas gathering and processing assets.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $58 million from power trading activities primarily due to short-term, favorable market conditions created by Winter Storm Uri in February of 2021;
•an increase of $25 million primarily due to revenues earned by our dual drive compression business under the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) responsive reserve program during Winter Storm Uri;
•an increase of $19 million due to improved margins at our dual drive compression business resulting from more favorable market pricing conditions;
•an increase of $12 million from Energy Transfer Canada due to the aggregate impact of multiples smaller changes;
•an increase of $9 million due to higher compressor sales and lower operating expenses in our compressor business; and
•an increase of $3 million due to a contract expiration at our natural resources business in 2020; partially offset by
•a decrease of $13 million due to higher power costs at our dual drive compression business; 
•a decrease of $5 million in merger and acquisition expenses primarily driven by expenses related to the Enable Acquisition; and
•a decrease of $42 million from 2020 insurance proceeds received on settled claims related to our MTBE litigation.

Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.5%, primarily due to the impacts of lower volumes and market prices among several of our core operating segments resulting primarily from COVID-19 related demand reductions. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $136 million from our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment primarily due to higher throughput volumes, an increase of $68 million from our midstream segment primarily due to the restructuring and assignment of certain gathering and processing contracts, and an increase of $74 million from our investment in Sunoco LP segment primarily due to increased gross profit per gallon sold and a decrease in operating costs. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was also offset by a net increase of approximately $569 million from recent acquisitions and assets placed in service.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased primarily due to the following:
•interest expenses recognized by the Partnership (excluding Sunoco LP and USAC) decreased by $8 million due to lower borrowing costs on both recently refinanced and floating rate debt, and higher capitalized interest offsetting a higher consolidated debt balance;
•an increase of $2 million recognized by USAC was primarily due to a full year of interest expense incurred in the current period on its senior notes 2027 issued in March 2019, partially offset by reduced borrowings and lower weighted average interest rates under its credit agreement; and
•an increase of $2 million recognized by Sunoco LP due to a slight increase in average long-term debt.
Impairment Losses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments totaling $2.2 billion and fixed asset impairments totaling $58 million, primarily due to decreases in projected future cash flows as a result of overall market demand decline. In addition, USAC recognized a goodwill impairment of $619 million as well as an equipment impairment of $8 million based on changes in market conditions.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recognized goodwill impairments totaling $21 million primarily due to changes in assumptions related to projected future revenues and cash flows. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, Sunoco LP recognized a $47 million write-down on assets held for sale related to its ethanol plant in Fulton, New York, and USAC recognized a $6 million fixed asset impairment related to certain idle compressor assets.
Losses on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Losses on interest rate derivatives decreased by $38 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year primarily due to a $400 million reduction in notional amount of outstanding forward-starting interest rate derivatives, which was partially offset by lower average interest rates and expenses related to the early termination and settlement of forward-starting interest rate derivatives.
Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation reserve adjustments were recorded for the inventory associated with Sunoco LP primarily driven by changes in fuel prices between periods.
Losses on Extinguishments of Debt. Year ended December 31, 2020 amounts were related to Senior Note redemption in January 2020. In addition, Sunoco LP recognized a $13 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of its outstanding 2023 senior notes in 2020.
Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliate. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recorded an impairment to its investment in White Cliffs of $129 million due to a decrease in projected future revenues and cash flows as a result of the overall market demand decline that occurred subsequent to the SemGroup acquisition and related purchase price allocation in December 2019.

Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts. 
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, income tax expense increased due to higher earnings from the Partnership’s consolidated corporate subsidiaries in 2020 and the impact of a current state tax benefit (net of federal benefit) of $17 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to a change in estimate related to state

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $188 million in realized natural gas sales and other due to lower realized gains from pipeline optimization activity; and 
•a decrease of $2 million in retained fuel revenues primarily due to lower natural gas prices; offset by 
•an increase of $36 million in realized storage margin primarily due to higher realized gains on financial derivatives used to hedge physical storage gas;
•a decrease of $13 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $5 million decrease in outside services, a $4 million decrease in employee costs, a $3 million decrease in maintenance project costs and a $2 million decrease in ad valorem taxes; and
•an increase of $3 million in transportation fees primarily due to volume ramp-ups on Red Bluff Express pipeline and new contracts partially offset by the expansion of certain contracts on Regency Intrastate Gas Systems.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, transported volumes decreased primarily due to lower crude production resulting in lower associated gas production and contract expirations on our Tiger Pipeline, as well as multiple weather events and maintenance of third-party facilities impacting our assets along the Gulf Coast.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $102 million in revenues primarily due to a decrease of $63 million from a contractual rate adjustment on commitments at our Lake Charles LNG facility effective January 2020, a decrease of $30 million due to additional revenue recognized in 2019 associated with a shipper bankruptcy, a decrease of $28 million due to lower utilization and lower rates on our Panhandle and Trunkline systems, a decrease of $12 million in transportation fees as a result of multiple weather events and maintenance on third-party facilities connected to our systems, and a decrease of $8 million resulting from contract expirations on ETC Tiger. These decreases were partially offset by higher reservation revenue on Transwestern and Rover resulting from higher contracted capacity and higher parking revenue resulting from timing of transactions; and
•a decrease of $26 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to lower earnings from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline primarily as a result of lower rates received following the expiration of certain contracts, partially offset by an increase from Citrus primarily due to higher revenues resulting from new contracts, rate increases on existing contracts, the recognition of a contract exit fee and lower operating expenses; partially offset by
•a decrease of $2 million in operating expense primarily due to $22 million in refunds of ad valorem taxes on Transwestern and lower current year assessments, a $13 million decrease in employee costs and a $9 million decrease in maintenance project costs resulting from cost-cutting initiatives, partially offset by $38 million in bad debt expense associated with a shipper bankruptcy and a $5 million increase related to the valuation of inventory on Panhandle; and
•a decrease of $13 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily resulting from a $17 million favorable settlement related to excise taxes on Rover and a $5 million decrease in employee costs due to cost-cutting initiatives, partially offset by a $4 million increase in legal and consulting fees related to an ongoing rate case and shipper bankruptcies and a $3 million increase in allocated overhead costs.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, gathered volumes decreased primarily in the South Texas and Northeast regions, partially offset by the impact of the SemGroup acquisition in the Mid-Continent/Panhandle region and volume growth in the Ark-La-Tex and Permian regions. NGL production increased due to the impact of the SemGroup acquisition in the Mid-Continent/Panhandle region and ethane uplift in the Permian, South Texas and North Texas regions.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our midstream segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $55 million in fee-based margin due to the impact of the SemGroup acquisition in the Mid-Continent/Panhandle region and recognized $103 million related to the restructuring and assignment of certain gathering and processing contracts in the Ark-La-Tex region, which included the recognition of $75 million of deferred revenue received in prior periods. This increase was partially offset by the impact of volume declines in the South Texas region;
•a decrease of $86 million in operating expenses due to cost-saving initiatives, including a decrease of $39 million in outside services, $25 million in materials, $14 million in employee costs and $8 million in office expenses; and
•a decrease of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses due to a decrease in allocated overhead costs resulting from overall corporate cost reductions; partially offset by
•a decrease of $70 million in non-fee-based margin due to unfavorable NGL prices of $75 million and favorable natural gas prices of $5 million; and
•a decrease of $11 million in non-fee-based margin due to decreased throughput volume, primarily in the South Texas region.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, NGL transportation volumes increased due to higher throughput volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system. In addition, throughput barrels on our Texas NGL pipeline system increased due to higher receipt of liquids production from both wholly-owned and third-party gas plants primarily in the Permian and North Texas regions, as well as higher export volumes feeding into our Nederland Terminal resulting from the initiation of service on our propane export pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Refined products transportation volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to prior year due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, which negatively impacted supply to our refined products transportation system, and less domestic demand for jet fuel and other refined products. These decreases in volumes were partially offset by the initiation of service of our JC Nolan diesel fuel pipeline in the third quarter of 2019.
NGL and refined products terminal volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019 and less domestic demand for jet fuel and other refined products. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes from our Mariner East system, an increase in loaded vessels at our Nederland Terminal, and the initiation of service on our JC Nolan diesel fuel pipeline and natural gasoline export project, both of which commences service in the third quarter of 2019.
Average fractionated volumes at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to the commissioning of our sixth and seventh fractionators in February 2019 and February 2020, respectively.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $179 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $128 million increase from higher throughput volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system, a $53 million increase from higher throughput volumes received from the Permian region, a $17 million increase due to the initiation of service on our JC Nolan diesel fuel pipeline in the third quarter of 2019, a $14 million increase from higher throughput volumes from the Barnett region, a $12 million increase from higher volumes from the South Texas region and a $3 million increase due to higher throughput on our Mariner West pipeline. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease from lower throughput volumes received from the Eagle Ford region, a $16 million decrease due to less demand for jet fuel and other refined products, and a $13 million decrease resulting from the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019;
•an increase of $62 million in fractionators and refinery services margin primarily due to a $57 million increase resulting from the commissioning of our sixth and seventh fractionators in February 2019 and February 2020, respectively, and higher NGL volumes from the Permian and Barnett regions feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility, and a $9 million increase in rail and truck volumes feeding our refinery services facility. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease due primarily to an expiration of a third-party blending contract during the second quarter of 2020;
•an increase of $27 million in storage margin primarily due to a $16 million increase from throughput fees generated from exported volumes and an $11 million increase from component product storage fees; and
•a decrease of $11 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower allocated overhead costs and lower employee costs resulting from cost-cutting initiatives; partially offset by
•a decrease of $89 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $90 million decrease resulting from an expiration of a third-party contract at our Nederland Terminal in the second quarter of 2020, a $29 million decrease due to lower third-party and intercompany volumes feeding our Marcus Hook Terminal, a $16 million decrease due to lower expense reimbursements in 2020, and a $14 million decrease due to less domestic demand for jet fuel and other refined products. These decreases were partially offset by a $60 million increase due to higher throughput on our Mariner East system; and
•a decrease of $56 million in marketing margin primarily due to an $87 million decrease due to lower margin from our butane blending business, a $37 million decrease in gasoline blending and optimization due primarily to unfavorable market conditions primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by a $47 million increase due to higher optimization gains from the sale of NGL component products at our Mont Belvieu facility and a $21 million increase in NGL export and rack volumes.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, crude transportation volumes were lower on our Texas pipeline system and our Bakken pipeline, driven by lower production in these regions due to lower crude oil prices as well as lower refinery utilization caused by COVID-19 demand destruction, partially offset by contributions from assets acquired in 2019. Crude terminal volumes were higher due to contributions from assets acquired in 2019, partially offset by lower Permian and Bakken pipeline volumes, reduced refinery utilization, and reduced export demand at our Nederland Terminal.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $693 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to a $430 million decrease from our Texas crude pipeline system due to lower utilization and lower average tariff rates realized, a $286 million decrease (excluding a net change of $84 million in unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) from our crude oil acquisition and marketing business primarily due to a significant contraction in spreads in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily impacting our Permian to Gulf Coast and Bakken to Gulf Coast trading operations, a $224 million decrease due to lower volumes on our Bakken Pipeline due to lower basin production, and a $35 million decrease in throughput at our crude terminals primarily driven by lower Permian and Bakken volumes, reduced refinery utilization from COVID-19 demand destruction, reduced export demand, and hurricanes impacting operations in the third quarter of 2020; partially offset by a $285 million increase related to assets acquired in 2019; and
•an increase of $33 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to legal expenses, higher insurance expenses, and an increase related to assets acquired in 2019; partially offset by
•a decrease of $44 million in operating expenses primarily due to lower volume-driven pipeline expenses and corporate cost-cutting initiatives, partially offset by increased costs related to assets acquired in 2019; and
•an increase of $29 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to assets acquired in 2019.

The Investment in Sunoco LP segment reflects the consolidated results of Sunoco LP.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to the Investment in Sunoco LP segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase in the gross profit on motor fuel sales of $32 million, primarily due to a 18% increase in gross profit per gallon sold and the receipt of a $13 million make-up payment under Sunoco LP’s fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc., partially offset by a 13% decrease in gallons sold; and
•a decrease of $54 million in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense, primarily attributable to lower employee costs, maintenance, advertising, credit card fees and utilities, which was partially offset by a $12 million charge for current expected credit losses on Sunoco LP’s accounts receivable in connection with the financial impact from COVID-19; and 
•an increase of $6 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to Sunoco LP’s investment in the JC Nolan joint venture; partially offset by 
•a decrease of $18 million in non-motor fuel sales and lease gross profit primarily due to reduced credit card transactions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and rent concessions in 2020.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our investment in USAC segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $10 million in operating expenses primarily driven by a decrease in average revenue generating horsepower and reduced headcount; partially offset by
•a decrease of $22 million in segment margin primarily driven by a decrease in revenues primarily due to a decrease in average revenue generating horsepower as a result of a decline in demand for compression services primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. crude oil and natural gas activities and a reduction of ancillary maintenance work, offset by a decrease in costs of products sold of $9 million.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $97 million from the acquisition of Energy Transfer Canada; and
•an increase of $26 million primarily due to insurance proceeds received on settled claims related to our MTBE litigation; partially offset by 
•a decrease of $22 million due to lower coal royalties and producer demand from our natural resources business;
•a decrease of $35 million due to lower revenue from our compressor equipment business;
•a decrease of $12 million from adverse market conditions due to COVID-19 related demand destruction;
•a decrease of $28 million due to higher merger and acquisition expenses;

•a decrease of $6 million due to the elimination of Sunoco LP’s interest in the JC Nolan Joint Venture.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our ability to satisfy our obligations and pay distributions to Unitholders will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business and weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond management’s control. The significant trends and uncertainties that we currently believe could significantly impact our liquidity and cash flows going forward are discussed in “Trends and Outlook” above. 
We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and sources of funding to meet our cash requirements over the near term and for the longer term. We expect to satisfy our working capital needs through cash generated by our operations, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our Five-Year Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $336 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $2.03 billion. 
The Partnership’s material contractual obligations include long-term debt service, payments under operating leases, and purchase commitments. The Partnership’s obligations under its long-term debt agreements are described below under “Description of Indebtedness,” and information on the maturities and interest rates related to the Partnership’s long-term debt is available in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, information on the Partnership’s obligations under its lease arrangements is included in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
We define a purchase commitment as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are established at the inception of the contract. We have material purchase commitments for crude oil; as of December 31, 2021, those purchase commitments totaled an estimated $13.34 billion (of which $10.44 billion would be due in 2022) based on either the current market price for variable price contracts or the contracted price for fixed price contracts. 
We currently expect capital expenditures in 2022 to be within the following ranges (excluding capital expenditures related to our investments in Sunoco LP and USAC):

(1)Includes capital expenditures related to the Partnership’s proportionate ownership of the Bakken, Rover, and Bayou Bridge pipeline projects and our proportionate ownership of the Orbit Gulf Coast NGL export project.
The assets used in our natural gas and liquids operations, including pipelines, gathering systems and related facilities, are generally long-lived assets and do not require significant maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not have any significant financial commitments for maintenance capital expenditures in our businesses. From time to time we experience increases in pipe costs due to a number of reasons, including but not limited to, delays from steel mills, limited selection of 
mills capable of producing large diameter pipe timely, higher steel prices and other factors beyond our control. However, we include these factors in our anticipated growth capital expenditures for each year.
We generally fund maintenance capital expenditures and distributions with cash flows from operating activities. We generally expect to funds growth capital expenditures with proceeds of borrowings under our credit facilities, along with cash from operations.
Sunoco LP expects to invest at least $150 million in growth capital expenditures and approximately $50 million on maintenance capital expenditures in 2022. 
USAC currently plans to spend approximately $23 million in maintenance capital expenditures and currently has budgeted between $110 million and $120 million in expansion capital expenditures in 2022.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price of our products and services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, the successful integration of our acquisitions, and other factors.
Operating Activities
Changes in cash flows from operating activities between periods primarily result from changes in earnings (as discussed in “Results of Operations” above), excluding the impacts of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include recurring non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and non-cash compensation expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the periods presented primarily resulted from construction and acquisitions of assets, while changes in non-cash compensation expense resulted from changes in the number of units granted and changes in the grant date fair value for such grants. Cash flows from operating activities also differ from earnings as a result of non-cash charges that may not be recurring such as impairment charges and allowance for equity funds used during construction. The allowance for equity funds used during construction increases in periods when Energy Transfer has a significant amount of interstate pipeline construction in progress. Changes in operating assets and liabilities between periods result from factors such as the changes in the value of derivative assets and liabilities, timing of accounts receivable collection, payments on accounts payable, the timing of purchases and sales of inventories, and the timing of advances and deposits received from customers.
Following is a summary of operating activities by period:
Year Ended December 31, 2021
Cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $11.16 billion and net income was $6.69 billion.

Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of cash amounts paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures, cash distributions from our joint ventures, and cash proceeds from sales or contributions of assets or businesses. Changes in capital expenditures between periods primarily result from increases or decreases in our growth capital expenditures to fund our construction and expansion projects.
Following is a summary of investing activities by period:

Covenants Related to Our Credit Agreements
The agreements relating to the Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants customary for an issuer with an investment-grade rating from the rating agencies, which covenants include limitations on liens and a restriction on sale-leaseback transactions.
The Five-Year Credit Facility contains covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) the Partnership’s and certain of the Partnership’s subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:
•incur indebtedness;
•grant liens;
•enter into mergers;
•dispose of assets;
•make certain investments;
•make Distributions (as defined in the Five-Year Credit Facility) during certain Defaults (as defined in the Five-Year Credit Facility) and during any Event of Default (as defined in the Five-Year Credit Facility);
•engage in business substantially different in nature than the business currently conducted by the Partnership and its subsidiaries;
•engage in transactions with affiliates; and
•enter into restrictive agreements.
The applicable margin and rate used in connection with the interest rates and commitment fees, respectively, are based on the credit ratings assigned to our senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. The applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans under the Five-Year Credit Facility ranges from 1.125% to 2.000% and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.125% to 1.000%. The applicable rate for commitment fees under the Five-Year Credit Facility ranges from 0.125% to 0.300%. 
The Five-Year Credit Facility contains various covenants including limitations on the creation of indebtedness and liens and related to the operation and conduct of our business. The Five-Year Credit Facility also limits us, on a rolling four quarter basis, to a maximum Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as defined in the underlying credit agreement, of 5.0 to 1, which can generally be increased to 5.5 to 1 during a Specified Acquisition Period. Our Leverage Ratio was 3.07 to 1 at December 31, 2021, as calculated in accordance with the credit agreement.
Failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of our revolving credit facilities could require us to pay debt balances prior to scheduled maturity and could negatively impact the Partnership’s or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt and/or our ability to pay distributions to Unitholders.
Covenants Related to Transwestern
The agreements relating to the Transwestern senior notes contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional debt, the sale of assets and the payment of dividends and specify a maximum debt to capitalization ratio.
Covenants Related to Panhandle
Panhandle is not party to any lending agreement that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation due to a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, nor would a reduction in any credit rating, by itself, cause an event of default under any of Panhandle’s lending agreements.
Panhandle’s restrictive covenants include restrictions on liens securing debt and guarantees and restrictions on mergers and on the sales of assets. A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of Panhandle’s debt.

Sunoco LP Cash Distributions
The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus between Sunoco LP’s common unitholders and the holder of its IDRs based on the specified target distribution levels, after the payment of distributions to Class C unitholders. The amounts set forth under “marginal percentage interest in distributions” are the percentage interests of the IDR holder and the common unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus which Sunoco LP distributes up to and including the corresponding amount in the column “total quarterly distribution per unit target amount.” The percentage interests shown for common unitholders and IDR holder for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution.

                                                                                                                     Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions

Critical Accounting Estimates
The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules, and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. For further details on our accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the accrual for and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The natural gas industry conducts its business by processing actual transactions at the end of the month following the month of delivery. Consequently, the most current month’s financial results for the midstream, NGL and intrastate 
transportation and storage segments are estimated using volume estimates and market prices. Any differences between estimated results and actual results are recognized in the following month’s financial statements. Management believes that the operating results estimated for the year ended December 31, 2021 represent the actual results in all material respects.
Some of the other significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the timing of certain forecasted transactions that are hedged, the fair value of derivative instruments, useful lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization, purchase accounting allocations and subsequent realizability of intangible assets, fair value measurements used in the goodwill impairment test, market value of inventory, assets and liabilities resulting from the regulated ratemaking process, contingency reserves and environmental reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value Estimates in Business Combination Accounting and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Business combination accounting and quantitative impairment testing are required from time to time due to the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances, or annual testing requirements. For business combinations, assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value in connection with the initial recognition of the transaction. For impairment testing, long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired. An impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is recognized when circumstances indicate that a decline in the investment value is other than temporary. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset/goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Calculating the fair value of assets or reporting units in connection with business combination accounting or impairment testing requires management to make several estimates, assumptions and judgements, and in some circumstances management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those calculations.
In order to allocate the purchase price in a business combination or to test for recoverability when performing a quantitative impairment test, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, we make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located, the availability and prices of commodities, our ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements, the risks that exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful, our dependence on certain significant customers and producers, and competition from other companies, including major energy producers. While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to calculate the fair value, if future results are not consistent with our estimates, we could be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
The Partnership determines the fair value of its assets and/or reporting units using a discounted cash flow method, the guideline company method, the reproduction and replacement methods, or a weighted combination of these methods. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. The Partnership believes the estimates and assumptions used in our business combination accounting and impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, the Partnership determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit including estimates for capital expenditures, discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted industry rate, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit. Cash flow projections are derived from one year budgeted amounts and five year operating forecasts plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur. Under the guideline company method, the Partnership determines the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using a multi-year average. In addition, the Partnership estimates a reasonable control premium, when appropriate, representing the incremental value that accrues to the majority owner from the opportunity to dictate the strategic and operational actions of the business. Under the reproduction and replacement methods, the Partnership determines the fair value of assets based on the estimated installation, engineering, and set-up costs related to the asset; these methods require the use of trend factors, such as inflation indices.
One key assumption in these fair value calculations is management’s estimate of future cash flows and EBITDA. In accounting for a business combination, these estimates are generally based on the forecasts that were used to analyze the deal economics. For impairment testing, these estimates are based on the annual budget for the upcoming year and forecasted amounts for multiple subsequent years. The annual budget process is typically completed near the annual goodwill impairment testing date, and management uses the most recent information for the annual impairment tests. The forecast is also subjected to a 
comprehensive update annually in conjunction with the annual budget process and is revised periodically to reflect new information and/or revised expectations. The estimates of future cash flows and EBITDA are subjective in nature and are subject to impacts from the business risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for business combination accounting and impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period. Such changes in fair value estimates could result in changes to the fair value estimates used in business combination accounting, which could significantly impact results of operations in a period subsequent to the business combination, depending on multiple factors, including the timing of such changes. In the case of impairment testing, such changes could result in additional impairments in future periods; therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period, resulting in additional impairments.
In addition, we may change our method of impairment testing, including changing the weight assigned to different valuation models. Such changes could be driven by various factors, including the level of precision or availability of data for our assumptions. Any changes in the method of testing could also result in an impairment or impact the magnitude of an impairment.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Partnership recorded total assets of $8.58 billion, $12 million and $6.06 billion, respectively, in connection with business combinations.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Partnership recorded impairments totaling $3.01 billion and $74 million, respectively, including $129 million in impairments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2020, and $66 million and $53 million of long-lived asset impairments in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional information on the impairments recorded during these periods is available in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets. Depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets is provided using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives. Changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on our results of operation. The Partnership’s results of operations have not been significantly impacted by changes in the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets during the periods presented, and we do not anticipate any such significant changes in the future. However, changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to change the estimated useful lives of the assets, which could significantly impact the Partnership’s results of operations. Additional information on our accounting policies and the estimated useful lives associated with our long-lived assets is available in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Legal and Regulatory Matters. We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from claims, orders, judgments or settlements. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. We expense legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are revised, as required, as better information becomes available to us. The factors we consider when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of our legal counsel; (ii) our previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accruals of $144 million and $101 million, respectively, were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets related to these contingent obligations.
For more information on our litigation and contingencies, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this report.
Environmental Remediation Activities. The Partnership’s accrual for environmental remediation activities reflects anticipated work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The accrual for known claims is undiscounted and is based on currently available information, estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. It is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations, changing technologies and their associated costs, and changes in the economic environment. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities. 
Losses attributable to unasserted claims are generally reflected in the accruals on an undiscounted basis, to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We have established a wholly-owned captive insurance company to bear certain risks associated with environmental obligations related to certain sites that are no longer operating. The premiums paid to the captive insurance company include estimates for environmental claims that have been incurred but not reported, based on an actuarially determined fully developed claims expense estimate. In such cases, we accrue losses attributable to unasserted claims based on the discounted estimates that are used to develop the premiums paid to the captive insurance company.
In general, each remediation site/issue is evaluated individually based upon information available for the site/issue and no pooling or statistical analysis is used to evaluate an aggregate risk for a group of similar items (e.g., service station sites) in determining the amount of probable loss accrual to be recorded. The Partnership’s estimates of environmental remediation costs also frequently involve evaluation of a range of estimates. In many cases, it is difficult to determine that one point in the range of loss estimates is more likely than any other. In these situations, existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued. Accordingly, the low end of the range often represents the amount of loss which has been recorded. The Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet reflected $293 million and $306 million in environmental accruals as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon, among other things, the identification of any additional sites, the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site, the timing and nature of required remedial actions, the nature of operations at each site, the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements, the nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the availability of insurance coverage, the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations, inflation rates, terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of the Partnership’s liability at the sites, if any, in light of the number, participation level and financial viability of the other parties. The recognition of additional losses, if and when they were to occur, would likely extend over many years. Management believes that the Partnership’s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material. However, if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur or the assumptions used to estimate losses at multiple sites are adjusted, such changes could impact multiple facilities, formerly owned facilities and third-party sites at the same time. As a result, from time to time, significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur; however, management does not believe that any such charges would have a material adverse impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial position.
Deferred Income Taxes. Energy Transfer recognizes benefits in earnings and related deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and tax credit carryforwards. If necessary, a charge to earnings and a related valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized by the Partnership in the future. Deferred income tax assets attributable to state and federal NOLs and federal excess business interest expense carryforwards totaling $803 million have been included in Energy Transfer’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The state NOL carryforward benefits of $146 million ($116 million net of federal benefit) began expiring in 2021 with a substantial portion expiring between 2033 and 2039. Energy Transfer’s corporate subsidiaries have federal NOLs of $3.0 billion ($646 million in benefits) of which $1.1 billion will expire between 2031 and 2037. A total of $338 million of the federal net operating loss carryforward is limited under IRC §382. Although we expect to fully utilize the IRC §382 limited federal net operating loss, the amount utilized in a particular year may be limited. Any federal NOL generated in 2018 and future years can be carried forward indefinitely. We have determined that a valuation allowance totaling $12 million ($9 million net of federal income tax effects) is required for state NOLs as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to significant restrictions on their use in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A separate valuation allowance of $25 million is attributable to foreign tax credits. In making the assessment of the future realization of the deferred tax assets, we rely on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income based on historical and projected future operating results. The potential need for valuation allowances is regularly reviewed by management. If it is more likely than not that the recorded asset will not be realized, additional valuation allowances which increase income tax expense may be recognized in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made.
