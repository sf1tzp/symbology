Index to Financial Statements

OVERVIEW
The primary activities in which we are engaged, which are located in the United States, are as follows:
•natural gas operations, including the following:
•natural gas midstream and intrastate transportation and storage; 
•interstate natural gas transportation and storage; and 
•crude oil, NGL and refined products transportation, terminalling and acquisition and marketing activities as well as NGL storage and fractionation services.
In addition, we own investments in other businesses, including Sunoco LP and USAC, both of which are master limited partnerships.
Energy Transfer derives cash flows from distributions related to its investment in its subsidiaries, including Sunoco LP and USAC. The amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us is based on earnings from their respective business activities and the amount of available cash. Energy Transfer’s primary cash requirements are for distributions to its partners, general and administrative expenses and debt service requirements. Energy Transfer distributes its available cash remaining after satisfaction of the aforementioned cash requirements to its Unitholders on a quarterly basis.
We expect our subsidiaries to utilize their resources, along with cash from their operations, to fund their announced growth capital expenditures and working capital needs; however, Energy Transfer may issue debt or equity securities from time to time as we deem prudent to provide liquidity for new capital projects of our subsidiaries or for other partnership purposes.
General
Our primary objective is to increase the level of our distributable cash flow to our Unitholders over time by pursuing a business strategy that is currently focused on growing our subsidiaries’ natural gas and liquids businesses through, among other things, pursuing certain construction and expansion opportunities relating to our subsidiaries’ existing infrastructure and acquiring certain strategic operations and businesses or assets. The actual amounts of cash that we will have available for distribution will primarily depend on the amount of cash our subsidiaries generate from their operations.
Our reportable segments are as follows:
•intrastate transportation and storage;
•interstate transportation and storage;
•midstream;
•NGL and refined products transportation and services;
•crude oil transportation and services;
•investment in Sunoco LP;
•investment in USAC; and
•all other.
Recent Developments
Crestwood Acquisition
On November 3, 2023, Energy Transfer acquired Crestwood, which owns gathering and processing assets located in the Williston, Delaware and Powder River basins. Under the terms of the merger agreement, holders of Crestwood common units received 2.07 Energy Transfer common units for each Crestwood common unit held by them (the “Common Unit Merger Consideration”). Additionally, each outstanding Crestwood preferred unit was, at the election of the holder of such Crestwood preferred unit, either, (i) converted into a Series I Preferred Unit, which is a new preferred unit of Energy Transfer that has substantially similar terms, including with respect to economics and structural protections, as the Crestwood preferred units; (ii) redeemed in exchange for $9.857484 in cash plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such redemption; or (iii) converted into a Crestwood common unit at the then-applicable conversion ratio of one Crestwood common unit for ten Crestwood preferred units, and such Crestwood common units then received the Common Unit Merger Consideration. 
Index to Financial Statements

In total, consideration issued in the transaction included approximately 216 million Energy Transfer common units, 41 million Series I Preferred Units and $300 million in cash. Concurrent with the closing of the Crestwood acquisition, the Partnership assumed $2.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Crestwood senior notes and terminated its revolving credit facility, which included the repayment of $613 million in outstanding borrowings.
Lotus Midstream Acquisition
On May 2, 2023, Energy Transfer acquired Lotus Midstream for total consideration of $1.50 billion, including working capital. Consideration included $930 million in cash and approximately 44.5 million newly issued Energy Transfer common units, which had an aggregate acquisition-date fair value of $574 million. Lotus Midstream owns and operates Centurion Pipeline Company LLC, an integrated crude midstream platform located in the Permian Basin.
Sunoco LP’s Acquisitions and Divestiture
On January 22, 2024, Sunoco LP entered into a definitive agreement with NuStar to acquire NuStar in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately $7.3 billion, including assumed debt. Under the terms of the agreement, NuStar common unitholders will receive 0.4 Sunoco common units for each NuStar common unit. NuStar has approximately 9,500 miles of pipeline and 63 terminal and storage facilities that store and distribute crude oil, refined products, renewable fuels, ammonia and specialty liquids. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.
On January 11, 2024, Sunoco LP entered into a definitive agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. to sell 204 convenience stores located in West Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma for approximately $1.00 billion, including customary adjustments for fuel and merchandise inventory. As part of the sale, Sunoco LP will also amend its existing take-or-pay fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. to incorporate additional fuel gross profit. The transaction is expected to close promptly upon receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
On January 11, 2024, Sunoco LP also announced that it will acquire liquid fuels terminals in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Bantry Bay, Ireland from Zenith Energy for €170 million including working capital. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 
On May 1, 2023, Sunoco LP completed the acquisition of 16 refined product terminals located across the East Coast and Midwest from Zenith Energy for $111 million, including working capital.
Regulatory Update
Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Regulation
Rate Regulation
Effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related proposals, the FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. The FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. The FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that the FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership would not “double recover” its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost of service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. On July 18, 2018, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors’ income tax costs. On July 31, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC’s decision denying a separate master limited partnership recovery of an income tax allowance and its decision not to require the master limited partnership to refund accumulated deferred income tax balances. In light of the rehearing order’s clarification regarding an individual entity’s ability to argue in support of recovery of an income tax allowance and the court’s subsequent opinion upholding denial of an income tax allowance to a master limited partnership, the impact of the FERC’s policy on the treatment of income taxes on the rates we can charge for FERC-regulated transportation services is unknown at this time. 
Even without application of the FERC’s rate making-related policy statements and rulemakings, the FERC or our shippers may challenge the cost-of-service rates we charge. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many components, including ROE and tax-related components, but also other pipeline costs that will continue to affect FERC’s determination of just and reasonable cost-of-service rates. Moreover, we receive revenues from our pipelines based on a variety 
Index to Financial Statements

of rate structures, including cost-of-service rates, negotiated rates, discounted rates and market-based rates. Many of our interstate pipelines, such as Tiger Pipeline, Midcontinent Express Pipeline and Fayetteville Express Pipeline, have negotiated market rates that were agreed to by customers in connection with long-term contracts entered into to support the construction of the pipelines. Other systems, such as Florida Gas Transmission Pipeline, Transwestern and Panhandle, have a mix of tariff rate, discount rate and negotiated rate agreements. The revenues we receive from natural gas transportation services we provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates may decrease in the future as a result of changes to FERC policies, combined with the reduced corporate federal income tax rate established in the Tax Act. The extent of any revenue reduction related to our cost-of-service rates, if any, will depend on a detailed review of all of our cost-of-service components and the outcomes of any challenges to our rates by the FERC or our shippers.
On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a final rule establishing procedures to evaluate rates charged by the FERC-jurisdictional gas pipelines in light of the Tax Act and the FERC’s Revised Policy Statement. By an order issued on January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle’s then existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether the rates charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing. On August 30, 2019, Panhandle filed a general rate proceeding under Section 4 of the NGA. The NGA Section 5 and Section 4 proceedings were consolidated by order of the Chief Judge on October 1, 2019. The initial decision by the administrative law judge was issued on March 26, 2021, and on December 16, 2022, the FERC issued its order on the initial decision. On January 17, 2023, Panhandle and the Michigan Public Service Commission each filed a request for rehearing of FERC’s order on the initial decision, which were denied by operation of law as of February 17, 2023. On March 23, 2023, Panhandle appealed these orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“Court of Appeals”), and the Michigan Public Service Commission also subsequently appealed these orders. On April 25, 2023, the Court of Appeals consolidated Panhandle’s and Michigan Public Service Commission’s appeals and stayed the consolidated appeal proceeding while the FERC further considered the requests for rehearing of its December 16, 2022 order. On September 25, 2023, the FERC issued its order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which denied our requests for rehearing. Panhandle has timely filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the September 25, 2023 order. On October 25, 2023, Panhandle filed a limited request for rehearing of the September 25 order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which was subsequently denied by operation of law on November 27, 2023. On November 30, 2023, Panhandle submitted a refund report regarding the consolidated rate proceedings, which has been protested by several parties. On January 5, 2024, the FERC issued a second order addressing arguments raised on rehearing in which it modified certain discussion from its September 25, 2023 order and sustained its prior conclusions. Panhandle has timely filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the January 5, 2024 order.
Pipeline Certification
The FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 (“Pipeline Certification NOI”), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. On February 18, 2021, the FERC issued another NOI (“2021 NOI”), reopening its review of the 1999 Policy Statement. Comments on the 2021 NOI were due on May 26, 2021; we filed comments in the FERC proceeding. In September 2021, FERC issued a Notice of Technical Conference on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation related to natural gas infrastructure projects authorized under Sections 3 and 7 of the NGA. A technical conference was held on November 19, 2021, and post-technical conference comments were submitted to the FERC on January 7, 2022.
On February 18, 2022, the FERC issued two new policy statements: (1) an Updated Policy Statement on the Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Facilities and (2) a Policy Statement on the Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Natural Gas Infrastructure Project Reviews (“2022 Policy Statements”), to be effective that same day. On March 24, 2022, the FERC issued an order designating the 2022 Policy Statements as draft policy statements, and requested further comments. The FERC will not apply the now draft 2022 Policy Statements to pending applications or applications to be filed at FERC until it issues any final guidance on these topics. Comments on the 2022 Policy Statements were due on April 25, 2022, and reply comments were due on May 25, 2022. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the 2022 Policy Statements that might affect our natural gas pipeline or LNG facility projects, or when such new policies, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in these policy statements would affect us in a materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.
Interstate Common Carrier Regulation
Liquids pipelines transporting in interstate commerce are regulated by FERC as common carriers under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”). Under the ICA, the FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPI-FG. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC liquids index to change transportation rates annually. The 
Index to Financial Statements

indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. The FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. 
On December 17, 2020, FERC issued an order establishing a new index of PPI-FG plus 0.78%. The FERC received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order and on January 20, 2022, granted rehearing and modified the oil index. Specifically, for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, FERC-regulated liquids pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG minus 0.21%. FERC directed liquids pipelines to recompute their ceiling levels for July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, as well as the ceiling levels for the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, based on the new index level. Where an oil pipeline’s filed rates exceed its ceiling levels, FERC ordered such oil pipelines to reduce the rate to bring it into compliance with the recomputed ceiling level to be effective March 1, 2022. Some parties sought rehearing of the January 20 order with FERC, which was denied by FERC on May 6, 2022. Certain parties have appealed the January 20 and May 6 orders. Such appeals remain pending at the D.C. Circuit.
On October 20, 2022, the FERC issued a policy statement on the Standard Applied to Complaints Against Oil Pipeline Index Rate Changes to establish guidelines regarding how the FERC will evaluate shipper complaints against oil pipeline index rate increases. Specifically, the policy statement adopted the proposal in the FERC’s earlier Notice of Inquiry issued on March 25, 2020 to eliminate the “Substantially Exacerbate Test” as the preliminary screen applied to complaints against index rate increases and instead adopt the proposal to apply the “Percentage Comparison Test” as the preliminary screen for both protests and complaints against index rate increases. At this time, we cannot determine the effect of a change in the FERC’s preliminary screen for complaints against index rates changes, however, a revised screen would result in a threshold aligned with the existing threshold for protests against index rate increases. Any complaint or protest raised by a shipper could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Air Quality Standards
The EPA recently finalized its Good Neighbor Plan (the “Plan”) which seeks to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants and other industrial facilities from 23 upwind states which the EPA determined is contributing to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment and interfering with maintenance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in downwind states. As part of the Plan, the EPA announced that it would be issuing prescriptive emission standards for several sectors, including certain new and existing internal combustion engines of a certain size used in pipeline transportation of natural gas. The EPA’s final rule was to become effective on August 4, 2023, and the prescribed emission standards were scheduled to be effective in 2026; however, of the nine states impacted within the Partnership’s footprint, effectiveness of the rule is currently stayed in six states and pending a decision on a stay in three other states. Additionally, other operators and industry groups have challenged the Plan and sought a stay in the D.C. Circuit. Although the stay was denied, it was promptly followed by the filing of an emergency stay application with the U.S. Supreme Court, which will be heard on February 19, 2024, all while EPA has proposed adding five more states to the Plan. The Partnership currently estimates that the final rule would require retrofitting or replacement of approximately 192 engines in its interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage operations. The Partnership is involved in challenging application of the Plan in the nine states impacted within its footprint. Compliance with the Plan (if implementation is not stayed or otherwise delayed) will still require substantial capital expenditures which could adversely affect our business in future periods. However, at this time, we are still assessing the potential costs of this rule and, given uncertainties resulting from the multiple legal challenges filed against the Plan in various states, in the DC Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, we cannot predict with any certainty what the final costs of compliance for the Plan for the Partnership ultimately may be. 
Trends and Outlook
Overall, we believe the Partnership’s outlook is strong, as it has a stable business that has demonstrated its ability to manage through various market cycles. We expect future growth to be supported by production improvements, improved market conditions, and increased utilization of our existing assets, as well as strong domestic and international demand for our products.
While we anticipate that current and projected commodity prices and the related impact to activity levels in both the upstream and midstream sectors will continue to impact our business, we cannot predict the ultimate magnitude of that impact and expect it to be varied across our operations, depending on the region, customer, type of service, contract term and other factors.
In addition, the U.S. economy has experienced higher-than-average inflation in recent years, which has resulted in higher costs for labor, services, and materials. Our suppliers and customers also face inflationary pressures, and our throughput volumes may be impacted if producers are constrained. While the rate and scope of various inflationary factors may increase our operating costs and capital expenditures materially, we anticipate that any such impacts would be recoverable in the prices of our services.
Index to Financial Statements

Ultimately, the extent to which our business will be impacted by future market developments depends on factors beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In response to the recent market volatility and uncertainties, we have reduced growth capital spending in recent years, and we expect to continue to maintain a prudent level of growth capital spending going forward. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on our capital expenditures over the last two years and our forecasted capital expenditures for 2024.
We currently have ample liquidity to fund our business, and we do not anticipate any liquidity concerns in the immediate future (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). In addition, we continue to have access to the debt capital markets on generally favorable terms. We will continue to evaluate growth projects and acquisitions as such opportunities may be identified in the future.
In addition to the trends and outlook discussed above with respect to the Partnership’s existing business and finances, we also anticipate that the Partnership will continue to increase its focus on the development of alternative energy projects. The Partnership has announced several such projects recently and will continue to pursue opportunities aimed at continuing to reduce its environmental footprint throughout its operations.
Results of Operations
We report Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as measures of segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as total Partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, inventory valuation adjustments, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items, as well as certain non-recurring gains and losses. Inventory adjustments that are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA represent only the changes in lower of cost or market reserves on inventory that is carried at LIFO. These amounts are unrealized valuation adjustments applied to Sunoco LP’s fuel volumes remaining in inventory at the end of the period.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts for unconsolidated affiliates based on the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates. The use of Segment Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates as an analytical tool should be limited accordingly.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as reported for each segment in the following table, is analyzed in the section titled “Segment Operating Results.” Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of the Partnership’s fundamental business activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP measures.

Net Income. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, net income decreased $574 million, or approximately 10%, primarily due to the recognition of a $627 million non-operating litigation-related loss, as well as decreases in gains on interest rate derivatives and increases in interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; each of these items is discussed further below. The impacts of these decreases were partially offset by an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, as well as the impacts of impairment and other losses recognized in the prior period; these items are also discussed further below. The change to net income also reflects changes in Adjusted EBITDA, which are summarized below and discussed in more detail in “Segment Operating Results.”
Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased $605 million primarily due to favorable results in multiple segments. The most significant increase was in our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment, which reflected higher throughput and contractual rates, as well as favorable impacts from optimization. Our crude oil transportation and services segment and our interstate transportation and storage segment also contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA primarily due to higher volumes, as well as the impacts of recently acquired assets and assets recently placed in service. The increases from these segments were partially offset by a decrease in our midstream segment, primarily driven by the impacts of natural gas and NGL prices, and a decrease in our intrastate transportation and storage segment, which was impacted by lower pipeline optimization.
Additional information on changes impacting Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year is available below and in “Segment Operating Results.”
Index to Financial Statements

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased primarily due to higher interest rates on floating rate debt.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period last year, income tax expense increased due to higher earnings from the Partnership’s consolidated corporate subsidiaries.
Impairment Losses and Other. For the year ended December 31, 2023, impairment losses and other consisted of impairment losses incurred by USAC related to its compression equipment.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment losses and other included an $85 million loss on the deconsolidation of Energy Transfer Canada, which was recorded upon the completion of the sale in August 2022. The amount also included a $300 million impairment related to Energy Transfer Canada’s assets recorded in March 2022 based on the anticipated proceeds from the expected sale of those assets. The remainder of the impairment losses were from USAC’s recognition of impairment losses related to its compression equipment.
Gains on Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period. Gains on interest rate derivatives resulted from changes in forward interest rates, which caused our forward-starting swaps to change in value. The magnitude of the gains during the respective periods also reflected changes in the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding during the respective periods.
Unrealized Gains on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments. Inventory valuation adjustments represent changes in lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method on Sunoco LP’s inventory. These amounts are unrealized valuation adjustments applied to fuel volumes remaining in inventory at the end of the period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, a decline in fuel prices caused the lower of cost or market reserve requirements to increase by $114 million, which reduced net income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase in fuel prices caused the lower of cost or market reserve requirements to decrease by $5 million, which increased net income.

Non-Operating Litigation-Related Loss. Non-operating litigation-related loss recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023 represents the loss associated with the Williams Litigation, which is discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Other, net. Other, net primarily includes amortization of regulatory assets and other income and expense amounts.

Segment Operating Results
We evaluate segment performance based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is one of the performance measures used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments.
The following tables identify the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as follows:
•Segment margin, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts represent the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements that are attributable to each segment. 
•Unrealized gains or losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments. These are the unrealized amounts that are included in cost of products sold to calculate segment margin. These amounts are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, the unrealized losses are added back and the unrealized gains are subtracted to calculate the segment measure. 
Index to Financial Statements

•Non-cash compensation expense. These amounts represent the total non-cash compensation recorded in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses related to equity awards. This expense is not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and therefore is added back to calculate the segment measure.
•Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates.
In the following analysis of segment operating results, a measure of segment margin is reported for segments with sales revenues. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented. 
In addition, for certain segments, the following sections include information on the components of segment margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of segment margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin and other margin. These components of segment margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of segment margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased primarily due to increased utilization on our Texas intrastate assets, partially offset by decreased production from our Haynesville assets.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:
•a decrease of $247 million in realized natural gas sales and other primarily due to lower pipeline optimization from both physical sales and settled derivatives; and
•a decrease of $122 million in retained fuel revenues related to lower natural gas prices; partially offset by
•a decrease of $55 million in operating expenses related to a decrease in cost of fuel consumption from lower natural gas prices;
•an increase of $24 million in transportation fees primarily due to new contracts on our Texas system and Haynesville assets; and
•an increase of $6 million in storage margin primarily due to higher storage optimization from hedged inventory activity.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased primarily due to our Gulf Run system going in service in December 2022 as well as more capacity sold and higher utilization on our Transwestern, Rover and Trunkline systems. 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $143 million in segment margin primarily due to a $141 million increase resulting from our Gulf Run system being placed in service in December 2022, a $47 million increase in transportation revenue from several of our interstate pipeline systems due to higher contracted volumes and higher rates, an $18 million increase related to a shipper bankruptcy, a $20 million increase in parking and storage revenue and a $5 million increase in interruptible utilization. These increases were partially offset by a $58 million decrease due to lower operational gas sales resulting from lower prices, a $23 million decrease due to lower rates on our Panhandle system resulting from a FERC rate case and an $8 million decrease in liquids revenue due to lower prices;
Index to Financial Statements

•a decrease of $45 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $65 million decrease from the revaluation of system gas and a $10 million decrease in ad valorem taxes due to lower assessments on several of our interstate pipelines. These decreases were partially offset by $25 million of incremental expenses from our Gulf Run system being placed in service in December 2022 and higher maintenance project costs of $4 million;
•a decrease of $16 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to an $11 million decrease in M&A related expenses and a $7 million decrease in professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by $3 million of incremental expenses from our Gulf Run system being placed in service in December 2022; and
•an increase of $88 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to an increase of $76 million from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline joint venture due to capacity sold at higher rates, a $9 million increase from our Citrus joint venture due to revenues from new projects and lower operating expenses and an $8 million increase from our Southeast Supply Header joint venture due to increased capacity sold at higher rates. These increases were partially offset by a $6 million decrease from our Fayetteville Express Pipeline joint venture due to the expiration of a foundation shipper contract; partially offset by
•a decrease of $36 million in other Adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the 2022 recognition of certain amounts related to shipper bankruptcies.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, NGL transportation volumes increased primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region, on our Mariner East pipeline system and on our Gulf Coast export pipelines. The increase in transportation volumes and the commissioning of our eighth fractionator in August 2023 also led to higher fractionated volumes at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:
•an increase of $273 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $136 million increase resulting from higher throughput and contractual rate escalations on our Texas y-grade pipeline system, a $95 million increase resulting from higher throughput and contractual rate escalations on our Mariner East pipeline system, a $41 million increase from higher export volumes feeding into our Nederland Terminal, a $27 million increase from higher throughput and contractual rate escalations on our refined product pipelines, a $12 million increase from the timing of third-party deficiency payments on our Northeast region pipelines and a $7 million increase from higher throughput on our Mariner West pipeline. These increases were partially offset by intrasegment charges of $29 million and $17 million which were fully offset within our marketing and fractionation margins, respectively;
•an increase of $260 million in marketing margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to higher gains during 2023 from the optimization of hedged NGL and refined product inventories, as well as intrasegment margin of $29 million which was fully offset within our transportation margin;
•an increase of $193 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $120 million increase from our Marcus Hook Terminal due to contractual rate escalations and higher throughput, a $65 million increase from higher export volumes

loaded at our Nederland Terminal, a $4 million increase due to higher throughput from our refined product marketing terminals and a $3 million increase from tank leases at our Eagle Point Terminal;
•a decrease of $70 million in operating expenses primarily due to an $87 million decrease in gas and power utility costs, partially offset by a $16 million increase in employee costs;
•an increase of $38 million in fractionators and refinery services margin primarily due to a $29 million increase resulting from higher volumes and $17 million in intrasegment margin which was fully offset within our transportation margin. These increases were partially offset by an $8 million decrease from our refinery services business;
•an increase of $35 million in storage margin associated with increased NGL export volumes; and
•an increase of $29 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to higher volumes on certain joint venture pipelines; partially offset by
•an increase of $30 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $13 million increase resulting from a one-time charge related to regulatory expenses, a $9 million increase in overhead expenses and a $6 million increase in insurance costs.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, crude oil transportation volumes were higher on our Texas pipeline system due to higher Permian crude oil production, higher gathered volumes and contributions from assets acquired in 2023. Bakken Pipeline volumes were also higher. Volumes on our Bayou Bridge Pipeline were higher due to continuing strong Gulf Coast refinery demand. Midcontinent systems were higher, driven by contributions from assets acquired in 2023. We also realized higher Bakken gathering volumes. Crude terminal volumes were higher due to growth in Permian and Bakken volumes, stronger Gulf Coast refinery utilization and contributions from assets acquired in 2023.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:

Amounts reflected in our all other segment primarily include:
•our natural gas marketing operations; 
•our wholly owned natural gas compression operations; 
•our investment in coal handling facilities; and
•our Canadian operations, until those assets were divested in August 2022.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to the net impacts of the following:
• a decrease of $35 million due to higher M&A expenses;
•a decrease of $80 million due to the sale of Energy Transfer Canada in 2022;
•a decrease of $25 million from our dual drive compression business due to lower gas prices and increased electricity cost;
•a decrease of $21 million due to less favorable power trading market conditions; 
•an increase of $8 million in ad valorem taxes due to tax credits utilized in 2022; and
•a decrease of $9 million in storage and trading gains; partially offset by
•an increase of $27 million due to increased sales in our compressor packaging business. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our ability to satisfy our obligations and pay distributions to Unitholders will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business, weather conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond management’s control. The significant trends and uncertainties that we currently believe could significantly impact our liquidity and cash flows going forward are discussed in “Trends and Outlook” above. 
We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and sources of funding to meet our cash requirements over the near term and for the longer term. We expect to satisfy our working capital needs through cash generated by our operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $161 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $3.56 billion. 
The Partnership’s material contractual obligations include long-term debt service, payments under operating leases and purchase commitments. The Partnership’s obligations under its long-term debt agreements are described below under “Description of Indebtedness,” and information on the maturities and interest rates related to the Partnership’s long-term debt is available in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, information on the Partnership’s obligations under its lease arrangements is included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

We define a purchase commitment as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are established at the inception of the contract. We have material purchase commitments for crude oil; as of December 31, 2023, those purchase commitments totaled an estimated $65.27 billion (of which $21.80 billion would be due in 2024) based on either the current market price for variable price contracts or the contracted price for fixed price contracts. 
We currently expect capital expenditures in 2024 to be within the following ranges (including capitalized interest and overhead, but excluding capital expenditures related to our investments in Sunoco LP and USAC):

The assets used in our natural gas and liquids operations, including pipelines, gathering systems and related facilities, are generally long-lived assets and do not require significant maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not have any significant financial commitments for maintenance capital expenditures in our businesses. From time to time, we experience increases in pipe costs due to a number of reasons, including but not limited to, delays from steel mills, limited selection of mills capable of producing large diameter pipe timely, higher steel prices and other factors beyond our control. However, we include these factors in our anticipated growth capital expenditures for each year.
We generally fund maintenance capital expenditures and distributions with cash flows from operating activities. We generally expect to funds growth capital expenditures with proceeds of borrowings under our credit facilities, along with cash from operations.
Sunoco LP expects to invest at least $200 million in growth capital expenditures and approximately $70 million in maintenance capital expenditures in 2024. 
USAC currently plans to spend approximately $32 million in maintenance capital expenditures and currently has budgeted between $115 million and $125 million in expansion capital expenditures in 2024.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price of our products and services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, the successful integration of our acquisitions and other factors.
Operating Activities
Changes in cash flows from operating activities between periods primarily result from changes in earnings (as discussed in “Results of Operations” above), excluding the impacts of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include recurring non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and non-cash compensation expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the periods presented primarily resulted from construction and acquisitions of assets, while changes in non-cash compensation expense resulted from changes in the number of units granted and changes in the grant date fair value for such grants. Cash flows from operating activities also differ from earnings as a result of non-cash charges that may not be recurring such as impairment charges and allowance for equity funds used during construction. The allowance for equity funds used during construction increases in periods when

Energy Transfer has a significant amount of interstate pipeline construction in progress. Changes in operating assets and liabilities between periods result from factors such as the changes in the value of derivative assets and liabilities, timing of accounts receivable collection, payments on accounts payable, the timing of purchases and sales of inventories, and the timing of advances and deposits received from customers.

Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of cash amounts paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures, cash distributions from our joint ventures, and cash proceeds from sales or contributions of assets or businesses. Changes in capital expenditures between periods primarily result from increases or decreases in our growth capital expenditures to fund our construction and expansion projects.
Following is a summary of investing activities by period:

Financing Activities
Changes in cash flows from financing activities between periods primarily result from changes in the levels of borrowings and equity issuances, which are primarily used to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. Distributions to partners increased between the periods as a result of increases in the number of common units outstanding or increases in the distribution rate.
Following is a summary of financing activities by period:
Year Ended December 31, 2023
Cash used in financing activities was $5.33 billion in 2023. In 2023, we had a net increase in our debt level of $714 million. During 2023, we paid distributions of $4.25 billion to our partners, we paid distributions of $1.69 billion to noncontrolling interests, and we paid distributions of $59 million to our redeemable noncontrolling interests. In addition, we received capital contributions of $3 million in cash from noncontrolling interests. During 2023, we incurred debt issuance costs of $45 million.
Year Ended December 31, 2022
Cash used in financing activities was $5.11 billion in 2022. In 2022, we had a net decrease in our debt level of $843 million. During 2022, we paid distributions of $3.05 billion to our partners, we paid distributions of $1.55 billion to noncontrolling interests, and we paid distributions of $49 million to our redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Covenants Related to Our Credit Agreements
The agreements relating to the Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants customary for an issuer with an investment-grade rating from the rating agencies, which covenants include limitations on liens and a restriction on sale-leaseback transactions.
The Five-Year Credit Facility contains covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) the Partnership’s and certain of the Partnership’s subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:
•incur indebtedness;
•grant liens;
•enter into mergers;
•dispose of assets;
•make certain investments;
Index to Financial Statements

•make Distributions (as defined in the Five-Year Credit Facility) during certain Defaults (as defined in the Five-Year Credit Facility) and during any Event of Default (as defined in the Five-Year Credit Facility);
•engage in business substantially different in nature than the business currently conducted by the Partnership and its subsidiaries;
•engage in transactions with affiliates; and
•enter into restrictive agreements.
The applicable margin and rate used in connection with the interest rates and commitment fees, respectively, are based on the credit ratings assigned to our senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. The applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans under the Five-Year Credit Facility ranges from 1.125% to 2.000% and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.125% to 1.000%. The applicable rate for commitment fees under the Five-Year Credit Facility ranges from 0.125% to 0.300%. 
The Five-Year Credit Facility contains various covenants including limitations on the creation of indebtedness and liens and related to the operation and conduct of our business. The Five-Year Credit Facility also limits us, on a rolling four quarter basis, to a maximum Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as defined in the underlying credit agreement, of 5.00 to 1.00, which can generally be increased to 5.50 to 1.00 during a Specified Acquisition Period. Our Leverage Ratio was 3.31 to 1.00 at December 31, 2023, as calculated in accordance with the credit agreement.
Failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of our revolving credit facilities could require us to pay debt balances prior to scheduled maturity and could negatively impact the Partnership’s or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt and/or our ability to pay distributions to Unitholders.

Sunoco LP Cash Distributions
Energy Transfer owns approximately 28.5 million Sunoco LP common units and all of Sunoco LP’s IDRs. As of December 31, 2023, Sunoco LP had approximately 84.4 million common units outstanding.
The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus between Sunoco LP’s common unitholders and the holder of its IDRs based on the specified target distribution levels, after the payment of distributions to Class C unitholders. The amounts set forth under “marginal percentage interest in distributions” are the percentage interests of the IDR holder and the common unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus which Sunoco LP distributes up to and including the corresponding amount in the column “total quarterly distribution per unit target amount.” The percentage interests shown for common unitholders and IDR holder for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules, and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. For further details on our accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the accrual for and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The natural gas industry conducts its business by processing actual transactions at the end of the month following the month of delivery. Consequently, the most current month’s financial results are estimated using volume estimates and market prices for our intrastate transportation and storage segment, our midstream segment, and our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment. Any differences between estimated results and actual results are recognized in the following month’s financial statements. Management believes that the operating results estimated for the year ended December 31, 2023 represent the actual results in all material respects.
Some of the other significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the timing of certain forecasted transactions that are hedged, the fair value of derivative instruments, useful lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization, purchase accounting allocations and subsequent realizability of intangible assets, fair value measurements used in the goodwill impairment test, market value of inventory, assets and liabilities resulting from the regulated ratemaking process, contingency reserves and environmental reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value Estimates in Business Combination Accounting and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Business combination accounting and quantitative impairment testing are required from time to time due to the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances, or annual testing requirements. For business combinations, assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value in connection with the initial recognition of the transaction. For impairment testing, long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired. An impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is recognized when circumstances indicate that a decline in the investment value is other than temporary. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset/goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Calculating the fair value of assets or reporting units in connection with business combination accounting or impairment testing requires management to make several estimates, assumptions and judgements, and in some circumstances management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those calculations.
In order to allocate the purchase price in a business combination or to test for recoverability when performing a quantitative impairment test, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, we make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located, the availability and prices of commodities, our ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements, the risks that exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful, our dependence on certain significant customers and producers, and competition from other companies, including major energy producers. While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to calculate the fair value, if future results are not consistent with our estimates, we could be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
Index to Financial Statements

The Partnership determines the fair value of its assets and/or reporting units using the discounted cash flow method, the guideline company method, the reproduction and replacement methods, or a weighted combination of these methods. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. The Partnership believes the estimates and assumptions used in our business combination accounting and impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, the Partnership determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit including estimates for capital expenditures, discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted industry rate, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit. Cash flow projections are derived from one year budgeted amounts and five year operating forecasts plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur. Under the guideline company method, the Partnership determines the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using a multi-year average. In addition, the Partnership estimates a reasonable control premium, when appropriate, representing the incremental value that accrues to the majority owner from the opportunity to dictate the strategic and operational actions of the business. Under the reproduction and replacement methods, the Partnership determines the fair value of assets based on the estimated installation, engineering, and set-up costs related to the asset; these methods require the use of trend factors, such as inflation indices.
One key assumption in these fair value calculations is management’s estimate of future cash flows and EBITDA. In accounting for a business combination, these estimates are generally based on the forecasts that were used to analyze the deal economics. For impairment testing, these estimates are based on the annual budget for the upcoming year and forecasted amounts for multiple subsequent years. The annual budget process is typically completed near the annual goodwill impairment testing date, and management uses the most recent information for the annual impairment tests. The forecast is also subjected to a comprehensive update annually in conjunction with the annual budget process and is revised periodically to reflect new information and/or revised expectations. The estimates of future cash flows and EBITDA are subjective in nature and are subject to impacts from the business risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for business combination accounting and impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period. Such changes in fair value estimates could result in changes to the fair value estimates used in business combination accounting, which could significantly impact results of operations in a period subsequent to the business combination, depending on multiple factors, including the timing of such changes. In the case of impairment testing, such changes could result in additional impairments in future periods; therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period, resulting in additional impairments.
In addition, we may change our method of impairment testing, including changing the weight assigned to different valuation models. Such changes could be driven by various factors, including the level of precision or availability of data for our assumptions. Any changes in the method of testing could also result in an impairment or impact the magnitude of an impairment.
During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership recorded total assets of $9.71 billion, $1.38 billion and $8.58 billion, respectively, in connection with business combinations.
During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership recorded impairments totaling $12 million, $386 million and $21 million, respectively. Additional information on the impairments recorded during these periods is available in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Management does not believe that any of the Partnership’s goodwill balances, long-lived assets or investments in unconsolidated affiliates is currently at significant risk of a material impairment; however, of the $4.02 billion of goodwill on the Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, approximately $368 million is recorded in reporting units for which the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20% or less in the most recent quantitative test.
Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets. Depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets is provided using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives. Changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on our results of operation. The Partnership’s results of operations have not been significantly impacted by changes in the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets during the periods presented, and we do not anticipate any such significant changes in the future. However, changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to change the estimated useful lives of the

assets, which could significantly impact the Partnership’s results of operations. Additional information on our accounting policies and the estimated useful lives associated with our long-lived assets is available in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Legal and Regulatory Matters. We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from claims, orders, judgments or settlements. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. We expense legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are revised, as required, as better information becomes available to us. The factors we consider when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of our legal counsel; (ii) our previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accruals of $285 million and $200 million, respectively, were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets related to these contingent obligations.
For more information on our litigation and contingencies, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this annual report.
Environmental Remediation Activities. The Partnership’s accrual for environmental remediation activities reflects anticipated work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The accrual for known claims is undiscounted and is based on currently available information, estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. It is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations, changing technologies and their associated costs, and changes in the economic environment. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities. 
Losses attributable to unasserted claims are generally reflected in the accruals on an undiscounted basis, to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We have established a wholly owned captive insurance company to bear certain risks associated with environmental obligations related to certain sites that are no longer operating. The premiums paid to the captive insurance company include estimates for environmental claims that have been incurred but not reported, based on an actuarially determined fully developed claims expense estimate. In such cases, we accrue losses attributable to unasserted claims based on the discounted estimates that are used to develop the premiums paid to the captive insurance company.
In general, each remediation site/issue is evaluated individually based upon information available for the site/issue and no pooling or statistical analysis is used to evaluate an aggregate risk for a group of similar items (e.g., service station sites) in determining the amount of probable loss accrual to be recorded. The Partnership’s estimates of environmental remediation costs also frequently involve evaluation of a range of estimates. In many cases, it is difficult to determine that one point in the range of loss estimates is more likely than any other. In these situations, existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued. Accordingly, the low end of the range often represents the amount of loss which has been recorded. The Partnership’s consolidated balance sheets reflected $277 million and $282 million in environmental accruals as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon, among other things, the identification of any additional sites, the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site, the timing and nature of required remedial actions, the nature of operations at each site, the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements, the nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the availability of insurance coverage, the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations, inflation rates, terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of the Partnership’s liability at the sites, if any, in light of the number, participation level and financial viability of the other parties. The recognition of additional losses, if and when they were to occur, would likely extend over many years. Management believes that the Partnership’s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material. However, if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur or the assumptions used to estimate losses at multiple sites are adjusted, such changes could impact multiple facilities, formerly owned facilities and third-party sites at the same time. As a result, from time to time, significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur; however, management does not believe that any such charges would have a material adverse impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial position.
Deferred Income Taxes. Energy Transfer recognizes benefits in earnings and related deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and tax credit carryforwards. If necessary, a charge to earnings and a related valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized by the Partnership in the future. Deferred income tax assets attributable to state and federal NOLs and federal excess business interest expense carryforwards 
Index to Financial Statements

totaling $371 million have been included in Energy Transfer’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The state NOL carryforward benefits of $96 million ($75 million net of federal benefit) began expiring in 2023 with a substantial portion expiring between 2033 and 2039. Energy Transfer’s corporate subsidiaries have federal NOLs of $1.4 billion ($291 million in benefits), all of which was generated in 2018 or later. A total of $341 million of the federal net operating loss carryforward is limited under IRC §382. Although we expect to fully utilize the IRC §382 limited federal net operating loss, the amount utilized in a particular year may be limited. Any federal NOL generated in 2018 and future years can be carried forward indefinitely. In making the assessment of the future realization of the deferred tax assets, we rely on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income based on historical and projected future operating results. The potential need for valuation allowances is regularly reviewed by management. If it is more likely than not that the recorded asset will not be realized, additional valuation allowances which increase income tax expense may be recognized in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made.
