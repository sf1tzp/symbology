ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Tabular dollar and unit amounts, except per unit data, are in millions)
Energy Transfer LP is a Delaware limited partnership whose common units are publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ET.”
The following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report.
Discussion and analysis of matters pertaining to the year ended December 31, 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K, but can be found under Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024. 
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Partnership” and “Energy Transfer” mean Energy Transfer LP and its consolidated subsidiaries.
OVERVIEW
The primary activities in which we are engaged, which are located in the United States, are as follows:
•natural gas operations, including the following:
◦natural gas midstream and intrastate transportation and storage; 
◦interstate natural gas transportation and storage; and 
•crude oil, NGL and refined products transportation, terminalling services and acquisition and marketing activities, as well as NGL storage and fractionation services and LNG regasification.
In addition, we own investments in other businesses, including Sunoco LP and USAC, both of which are master limited partnerships.
Index to Financial Statements

Energy Transfer derives cash flows from distributions related to its investment in its subsidiaries, including Sunoco LP and USAC. The amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us is based on earnings from their respective business activities and the amount of available cash. Energy Transfer’s primary cash requirements are for distributions to its partners, capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses and debt service requirements. Energy Transfer distributes its available cash remaining after satisfaction of the aforementioned cash requirements to its Unitholders on a quarterly basis.
We expect our subsidiaries to utilize their resources, along with cash from their operations, to fund their announced growth capital expenditures and working capital needs; however, Energy Transfer may issue debt or equity securities from time to time as we deem prudent to provide liquidity for new capital projects of our subsidiaries or for other partnership purposes.
General
Our primary objective is to increase the level of our distributable cash flow to our Unitholders over time by pursuing a business strategy that is currently focused on growing our subsidiaries’ natural gas and liquids businesses through, among other things, pursuing certain construction and expansion opportunities relating to our subsidiaries’ existing infrastructure and acquiring certain strategic operations and businesses or assets. The actual amounts of cash that we will have available for distribution will primarily depend on the amount of cash our subsidiaries generate from their operations.
Our reportable segments are as follows:
•intrastate transportation and storage;
•interstate transportation and storage;
•midstream;
•NGL and refined products transportation and services;
•crude oil transportation and services;
•investment in Sunoco LP;
•investment in USAC; and
•all other.
Recent Developments
WTG Midstream Acquisition
On July 15, 2024, Energy Transfer completed the acquisition of 100% of the membership interest in WTG Midstream. Consideration for the transaction was comprised of $2.28 billion in cash and approximately 50.8 million newly issued Energy Transfer common units, which had a fair value of approximately $833 million.
The acquired assets include approximately 6,000 miles of complementary gas gathering pipelines that extended Energy Transfer’s network in the Midland Basin. Also, as part of the transaction, the Partnership added eight gas processing plants with a total capacity of approximately 1.3 Bcf/d, and two additional processing plants that were under construction at closing. Since closing the transaction, one of these 200 MMcf/d processing plants was placed into service. 
Sunoco LP
NuStar Acquisition
On May 3, 2024, Sunoco LP completed the acquisition of all of the common units of NuStar. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NuStar common unitholders received 0.400 Sunoco LP common units for each NuStar common unit. In connection with the acquisition, Sunoco LP issued approximately 51.5 million common units, which had a fair value of approximately $2.85 billion, assumed debt totaling approximately $3.5 billion, including approximately $56 million of lease related financing obligations, and assumed preferred units with a fair value of approximately $800 million. Subsequent to the closing of the NuStar acquisition, Sunoco LP redeemed all outstanding NuStar preferred units totaling $784 million, redeemed NuStar's subordinated notes totaling $403 million and repaid and terminated the NuStar credit facility totaling $455 million. NuStar has approximately 9,500 miles of pipeline and 63 terminal and storage facilities that store and distribute crude oil, refined products, renewable fuels, ammonia and specialty liquids.

Zenith European Terminals Acquisition
On March 13, 2024, Sunoco LP completed the acquisition of liquid fuels terminals in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Bantry Bay, Ireland from Zenith Energy for approximately €170 million ($185 million), including working capital. The acquisition is expected to supply optimization for Sunoco LP’s existing East Coast business and continues its focus on growing its portfolio of stable midstream income.
Other Acquisition
On August 30, 2024, Sunoco LP acquired a terminal in Portland, Maine for approximately $24 million, including working capital.
West Texas Sale
On April 16, 2024, Sunoco LP completed the sale of 204 convenience stores located in West Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma to 7-Eleven, Inc. for approximately $1.00 billion, including customary adjustments for fuel and merchandise inventory. As part of the sale, Sunoco LP also amended its existing take-or-pay fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. to incorporate additional fuel gross profit. 
Joint Venture Transaction
ET-S Permian
Effective July 1, 2024, Energy Transfer and Sunoco LP formed ET-S Permian, a joint venture combining their respective crude oil and produced water gathering assets in the Permian Basin. Energy Transfer contributed its Permian crude oil and produced water gathering assets and operations to ET-S Permian. Sunoco LP contributed all of its Permian crude oil gathering assets and operations to ET-S Permian. Energy Transfer’s long-haul crude pipeline network that provides transportation of crude oil out of the Permian Basin to Nederland, Houston and Cushing is excluded from ET-S Permian.
ET-S Permian operates more than 5,000 miles of crude oil and water gathering pipelines with crude oil storage capacity in excess of 11 million barrels.
Energy Transfer holds a 67.5% interest, with Sunoco LP holding the remaining 32.5% interest in ET-S Permian. Energy Transfer is the operator of ET-S Permian. 
Regulatory Update
Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Regulation
Rate Regulation
Effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related proposals, the FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. The FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. The FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that the FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership would not “double recover” its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost of service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. On July 18, 2018, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors’ income tax costs. On July 31, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC’s decision denying a separate master limited partnership recovery of an income tax allowance and its decision not to require the master limited partnership to refund accumulated deferred income tax balances. In light of the rehearing order’s clarification regarding an individual entity’s ability to argue in support of recovery of an income tax allowance and the court’s subsequent opinion upholding denial of an income tax allowance to a master limited partnership, the impact of the FERC’s policy on the treatment of income taxes on the rates we can charge for FERC-regulated transportation services is unknown at this time. 
Even without application of the FERC’s rate making-related policy statements and rulemakings, the FERC or our shippers may challenge the cost-of-service rates we charge. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many 
Index to Financial Statements

components, including ROE and tax-related components, but also other pipeline costs that will continue to affect FERC’s determination of just and reasonable cost-of-service rates. Moreover, we receive revenues from our pipelines based on a variety of rate structures, including cost-of-service rates, negotiated rates, discounted rates and market-based rates. Many of our interstate pipelines, such as Tiger Pipeline, Midcontinent Express Pipeline and Fayetteville Express Pipeline, have negotiated market rates that were agreed to by customers in connection with long-term contracts entered into to support the construction of the pipelines. Other systems, such as Florida Gas Transmission Pipeline, Transwestern and Panhandle, have a mix of tariff rate, discount rate and negotiated rate agreements. The revenues we receive from natural gas transportation services we provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates may decrease in the future as a result of changes to FERC policies, combined with the reduced corporate federal income tax rate established in the Tax Act. The extent of any revenue reduction related to our cost-of-service rates, if any, will depend on a detailed review of all of our cost-of-service components and the outcomes of any challenges to our rates by the FERC or our shippers.
On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a final rule establishing procedures to evaluate rates charged by the FERC-jurisdictional gas pipelines in light of the Tax Act and the FERC’s Revised Policy Statement. By an order issued on January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle’s then existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to determine whether the rates charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing. On August 30, 2019, Panhandle filed a general rate proceeding under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. The Natural Gas Act Section 5 and Section 4 proceedings were consolidated by order of the Chief Judge on October 1, 2019. The initial decision by the administrative law judge was issued on March 26, 2021, and on December 16, 2022, the FERC issued its order on the initial decision. On January 17, 2023, Panhandle and the Michigan Public Service Commission each filed a request for rehearing of FERC’s order on the initial decision, which were denied by operation of law as of February 17, 2023. On March 23, 2023, Panhandle appealed these orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“Court of Appeals”), and the Michigan Public Service Commission also subsequently appealed these orders. On April 25, 2023, the Court of Appeals consolidated Panhandle’s and Michigan Public Service Commission’s appeals and stayed the consolidated appeal proceeding while the FERC further considered the requests for rehearing of its December 16, 2022 order. On September 25, 2023, the FERC issued its order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which denied our requests for rehearing. Panhandle filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the September 25, 2023 order. On October 25, 2023, Panhandle filed a limited request for rehearing of the September 25 order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which was subsequently denied by operation of law on November 27, 2023. On November 17, 2023, Panhandle provided refunds to shippers and on November 30, 2023, Panhandle submitted a refund report regarding the consolidated rate proceedings, which was protested by several parties. On January 5, 2024, the FERC issued a second order addressing arguments raised on rehearing in which it modified certain discussion from its September 25, 2023 order and sustained its prior conclusions. Panhandle has timely filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the January 5, 2024 order. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order rejecting Panhandle’s refund report. On June 27, 2024, Panhandle filed a revised refund report in compliance with the FERC’s May 28, 2024 order rejecting Panhandle’s refund report and a request for rehearing of the FERC’s May 28, 2024 order rejecting Panhandle’s refund report, and provided revised refunds to shippers, or in the case of shippers whose revised refunds are less than the original amounts refunded, notices of upcoming debits. One party protested Panhandle’s revised refund report, and Panhandle submitted a response to the protest on July 24, 2024. By notice issued July 29, 2024, Panhandle’s rehearing request was deemed denied. In an ordered issued September 9, 2024, FERC addressed arguments raised on rehearing, modified the discussion in the May 28, 2024 order and continued to reach the same result. On September 18, 2024, Panhandle petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of the September 9, 2024, July 29, 2024, and May 28, 2024 orders. On December 5, 2024, the FERC issued an order rejecting Panhandle’s June 27, 2024, refund report, ordering a corrected refund report and directing the issuance of additional refunds. On January 3, 2025, Panhandle submitted an adjusted refund report as well as a request for rehearing of the FERC’s December 5, 2024 order. The FERC approved the adjusted refund report by letter order dated January 23, 2025. On February 3, 2025, the FERC issued a Notice of Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law and Providing for Further Consideration. The request for rehearing will be addressed in a future order.
Pipeline Certification
The FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) on April 19, 2018, thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. On February 18, 2021, the FERC issued another NOI (“2021 NOI”), reopening its review of the 1999 Policy Statement. Comments on the 2021 NOI were due on May 26, 2021; we filed comments in the FERC proceeding. In September 2021, FERC issued a Notice of Technical Conference on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation related to natural gas infrastructure projects authorized under Sections 3 and 7 of the NGA. A technical conference was held on November 19, 2021, and post-technical conference comments were submitted to the FERC on January 7, 2022.
On February 18, 2022, the FERC issued two new policy statements: (1) an Updated Policy Statement on the Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Facilities (“2022 Certificate Policy Statement”) and (2) a Policy Statement on the Consideration of 
Index to Financial Statements

Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Natural Gas Infrastructure Project Reviews (“GHG Policy Statement”), to be effective that same day. On March 24, 2022, the FERC issued an order designating the 2022 Certificate Policy Statement and the GHG Policy Statement as draft policy statements, and requested further comments. The FERC stated that it will not apply the now draft policy statements to pending applications or applications to be filed at FERC until it issues any final guidance on these topics. Comments on the 2022 Certificate Policy Statement and GHG Policy Statement were due on April 25, 2022, and reply comments were due on May 25, 2022. On January 24, 2025, the FERC issued an order withdrawing the draft GHG Policy Statement and terminating the proceeding. The FERC has taken no further action on the 2022 Certificate Policy Statement. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the 2022 Certificate Policy Statement that might affect our natural gas pipeline or LNG facility projects, or when such new policy, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in this policy statement would affect us in a materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.
Interstate Common Carrier Regulation
Liquids pipelines transporting in interstate commerce are regulated by FERC as common carriers under the ICA. Under the ICA, the FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPI-FG. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC liquids index to change transportation rates annually. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. The FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. 
On December 17, 2020, FERC issued an order establishing a new index of PPI-FG plus 0.78%. The FERC received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order and on January 20, 2022, granted rehearing and modified the oil index. Specifically, for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, FERC-regulated liquids pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG minus 0.21%. FERC directed liquids pipelines to recompute their ceiling levels for July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, as well as the ceiling levels for the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, based on the new index level. Where an oil pipeline’s filed rates exceed its ceiling levels, FERC ordered such oil pipelines to reduce the rate to bring it into compliance with the recomputed ceiling level to be effective March 1, 2022. Some parties sought rehearing of the January 20 order with FERC, which was denied by FERC on May 6, 2022. Certain parties appealed the January 20 and May 6 orders. On July 26, 2024, the D.C. Circuit ruled in LEPA v. FERC that FERC violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the January 20 order modified the index without following notice and comment. As a result, the D.C. Circuit vacated the January 20 order and on September 17, 2024, the Commission reinstated the index level established by its original December 17 order, directed pipelines to file an informational filing to show their recomputed ceiling levels reflecting the reinstated index level and stated that pipelines may file to prospectively increase their indexed rates to their recomputed levels. On October 17, 2024, FERC issued a Supplemental NOPR that proposes a reduction to the currently effective index by one percent. The Supplemental NOPR, which remains pending before FERC, could result in the reimplementation through a notice-and-comment rulemaking of the same rulings that were vacated by the D.C. Circuit in LEPA v. FERC.
On October 20, 2022, the FERC issued a policy statement on the Standard Applied to Complaints Against Oil Pipeline Index Rate Changes to establish guidelines regarding how the FERC will evaluate shipper complaints against oil pipeline index rate increases. Specifically, the policy statement adopted the proposal in the FERC’s earlier Notice of Inquiry issued on March 25, 2020 to eliminate the “Substantially Exacerbate Test” as the preliminary screen applied to complaints against index rate increases and instead adopt the proposal to apply the “Percentage Comparison Test” as the preliminary screen for both protests and complaints against index rate increases. At this time, we cannot determine the effect of a change in the FERC’s preliminary screen for complaints against index rates changes, however, a revised screen would result in a threshold aligned with the existing threshold for protests against index rate increases. Any complaint or protest raised by a shipper could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Air Quality Standards
In 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) finalized its Good Neighbor Plan (the “Plan”) which seeks to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants and other industrial facilities from 23 upwind states which the EPA determined is contributing to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment and interfering with maintenance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in downwind states. As part of the Plan, the EPA announced that it would be issuing prescriptive emission standards for several sectors, including certain new and existing internal combustion engines of a certain size used in pipeline transportation of natural gas. The EPA’s final rule was to become effective on August 4, 2023, and the prescribed emission standards were scheduled to be effective in 2026.
Index to Financial Statements

Operators and industry groups have challenged the Plan in the D.C. Circuit, as well as the legal predicates to the individual upwind states’ inclusion in the Plan in the regional circuits. The effectiveness of the rule is currently stayed in the nine states within the Partnership’s footprint, by nature of judicial stays of the legal predicate to the Plan, by judicial stay of the Plan itself by the U.S. Supreme Court, or by the administrative stay issued by the EPA in October 2024. Proceedings as to both on the merits are ongoing. In the challenge to the Plan in the D.C. Circuit, oral argument is expected in early 2025 and a decision could take several months, projected late 2025.
The Partnership currently estimates that the final rule would require retrofitting or replacement of approximately 192 engines in its interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage operations. The Partnership is involved in challenging application of the Plan in the nine states impacted within its footprint. Compliance with the Plan (if implementation is not stayed or otherwise delayed) will still require substantial capital expenditures which could adversely affect our business in future periods. However, at this time, we are still assessing the potential costs of this rule and, given uncertainties resulting from the multiple legal challenges filed against the Plan in various states, in the DC Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, we cannot predict with any certainty what the final costs of compliance for the Plan for the Partnership ultimately may be.
Trends and Outlook
Overall, we continue to believe the Partnership’s outlook is strong, as it has a stable business that has demonstrated its ability to manage through various market cycles. We expect future growth to be supported by production improvements and increased utilization of our existing assets, as well as continued strong domestic and international demand for our products.
While we anticipate that current and projected commodity prices and the related impact to activity levels in both the upstream and midstream sectors will continue to impact our business, we cannot predict the ultimate magnitude of that impact and expect it to be varied across our operations, depending on the region, customer, type of service, contract term and other factors.
For 2025 and beyond, we expect increased demand from new data centers, power plants and LNG exports to support increased production, while increased global demand for petrochemicals and NGL feedstocks is expected to support higher volumes of NGL production and exports on existing assets and assets currently being developed or under construction. In addition, in the United States, we expect a more constructive regulatory environment under the new presidential administration, which we anticipate being favorable for project development and our operations in general.
Ultimately, the extent to which our business will be impacted by future market developments depends on factors beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In response to market volatility and other uncertainties, we have reduced growth capital spending in recent years. While we anticipate a healthy capital expenditure program in 2025 and beyond, we expect to continue to be prudent going forward as we allocate capital across our business segments. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on our capital expenditures over the last two years and our forecasted capital expenditures for 2025.
We currently have ample liquidity to fund our business, and we do not anticipate any liquidity concerns in the immediate future (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). In addition, we continue to have access to the debt capital markets on generally favorable terms. We will continue to evaluate growth projects and acquisitions as such opportunities may be identified in the future.
In addition to the trends and outlook discussed above with respect to the Partnership’s existing business and finances, we also anticipate that the Partnership will continue to develop alternative energy projects. The Partnership has announced several such projects recently and will continue to pursue opportunities aimed at continuing to reduce its environmental footprint throughout its operations.
Results of Operations
We report Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as measures of segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as total Partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, inventory valuation adjustments, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items, as well as certain non-recurring gains and losses. Inventory adjustments that are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA represent only the changes in lower of cost or market reserves on inventory that is carried at LIFO. These amounts are unrealized valuation adjustments applied to Sunoco LP’s fuel volumes remaining in inventory at the end of the period.
Index to Financial Statements

Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts for unconsolidated affiliates based on the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates. The use of Segment Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates as an analytical tool should be limited accordingly.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as reported for each segment in the following table, is analyzed in the section titled “Segment Operating Results.” Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of the Partnership’s fundamental business activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP measures.

Index to Financial Statements

Net Income. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, net income increased $1.27 billion, or approximately 24%, primarily due to the recognition of a $586 million gain on Sunoco LP’s sale of its West Texas assets in the current year, as well as the recognition of a $627 million non-operating litigation-related loss in the prior year. The change in net income also reflected higher segment margin from multiple segments, partially offset by increases in operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment losses, interest expense and income tax expense; these changes are discussed in more detail below and in “Segment Operating Results.”
Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.79 billion, or approximately 13%, primarily due to favorable results in multiple segments. The most significant increases were in our midstream segment, our crude oil transportation and services segment and our Investment in Sunoco LP segment, each of which reflected increases from recently acquired assets. Our midstream segment also reflected increases from higher volumes, as did our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment. Our intrastate transportation and storage segment also reflected increases from higher pipeline optimization.
Additional information on changes impacting Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year is available below and in “Segment Operating Results.”
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased primarily due to higher aggregate debt balances and higher interest rates on floating rate and recently refinanced debt.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period last year, income tax expense increased due to the taxable gain recognized by a corporate subsidiary of Sunoco LP on its sale of West Texas assets. 
Impairment Losses and Other. For the year ended December 31, 2024, impairment losses and other were primarily related to Sunoco LP’s termination of a lease in June 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023 impairment losses and other consisted of impairment losses incurred by USAC primarily related to its compression equipment.
Gains on Interest Rate Derivatives. Gains on interest rate derivatives resulted from changes in forward interest rates, which caused our forward-starting swaps to change in value. 
Unrealized (Gains) Losses on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in “Segment Operating Results” below, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Inventory Valuation Adjustments (Sunoco LP). Inventory valuation adjustments represent changes in lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method on Sunoco LP’s inventory. These amounts are unrealized valuation adjustments applied to fuel volumes remaining in inventory at the end of the period. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, decreases in fuel prices caused the lower of cost or market reserve requirements to increase by $86 million and $114 million, respectively, which reduced net income. 
(Gains) Losses on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2024, losses on extinguishment of debt included a $5 million loss on Energy Transfer’s redemption of its $450 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% senior notes due April 2029 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due April 2025, a $2 million loss recognized by Sunoco LP and a $5 million loss related to USAC’s redemption of its $725 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026.

Non-Operating Litigation-Related Loss. Non-operating litigation-related loss recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023 represents the loss associated with the The Williams Companies, Inc. litigation.
Gain on Sale of West Texas Assets (Sunoco LP). The gain on sale of West Texas assets relates to the gain recognized by Sunoco LP upon completion of the sale of convenience stores to 7-Eleven Inc. in April 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Sunoco LP recorded a $12 million reduction to the gain to reflect adjustments to the cash proceeds and certain balance sheet accounts associated with the business sold.

Segment Operating Results
We evaluate segment performance based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is one of the performance measures used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments.
The following tables identify the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as follows:
•Segment margin, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts represent the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements that are attributable to each segment. 
•Unrealized gains or losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments. These are the unrealized amounts that are included in cost of products sold to calculate segment margin. These amounts are not included 
Index to Financial Statements

in Segment Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, the unrealized losses are added back and the unrealized gains are subtracted to calculate the segment measure. 
•Non-cash compensation expense. These amounts represent the total non-cash compensation recorded in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses related to equity awards. This expense is not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and therefore is added back to calculate the segment measure.
•Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates.
In the following analysis of segment operating results, a measure of segment margin is reported for segments with sales revenues. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented. 
In addition, for certain segments, the following sections include information on the components of segment margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of segment margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin and other margin. These components of segment margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of segment margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, transported volumes increased primarily due to more capacity sold and higher utilization on our Panhandle, Trunkline and Gulf Run systems due to increased demand.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impact of the following:
•a decrease of $82 million in segment margin primarily due to a $36 million decrease due to lower operational gas sales resulting from lower prices, a $22 million decrease in parking revenue, a $21 million decrease due to lower volumes and a $10 million decrease due to lower rates on several of our interstate pipeline systems. These decreases were partially offset by an $8 million increase in storage revenue;
•an increase of $61 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $35 million increase in maintenance project costs, an aggregate $22 million increase in employee related costs, outside services, materials and office expense, and a $6 million increase from the revaluation of system gas;
•a decrease of $19 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to a $23 million decrease from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline joint venture due to capacity sold at lower rates and a $6 million decrease from our Citrus joint venture primarily due to higher operating expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $10 million increase from our Southeast Supply Header joint venture due to higher contracted volumes;
Index to Financial Statements

•an increase of $14 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher professional fees and employee costs; and
•a decrease of $5 million in other primarily due to the prior period recognition of certain amounts related to a shipper bankruptcy.

Volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, NGL transportation volumes increased primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions and on our Mariner East pipeline system. 
The increase in transportation volumes and the commissioning of our eighth fractionator in August 2023 also led to higher fractionated volumes at our Mont Belvieu NGL Complex.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impact of the following:
•an increase of $183 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $161 million increase from higher throughput and contractual rate escalations on our Mariner East and our Gulf Coast pipeline systems and a $24 million increase on our refined products pipelines, as well as a $12 million increase in intrasegment margin which was fully offset within our fractionators margin. These increases were partially offset by an $12 million decrease in intrasegment margin which is fully offset within our marketing margin and a $5 million decrease from the timing of third-party deficiency payments on our Northeast region pipelines;
•an increase of $92 million in terminal services margin primarily due to an $80 million increase in fees from loading volumes for export at our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals and a $12 million increase from higher throughput and storage at our refined product terminals;
•an increase of $47 million in fractionators and refinery services margin primarily due to a $56 million increase resulting from higher throughput as our eighth fractionator was placed in service in August 2023 and a $3 million increase from our refinery services business. These increases were partially offset by a $12 million decrease in intrasegment margin which was fully offset within our transportation margin;
Index to Financial Statements

•an increase of $29 million in marketing margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to higher gains during 2024 from the optimization of hedged NGL and refined product inventories and an $12 million increase in intrasegment margin which is fully offset within our transportation margin; and
•an increase of $8 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to increased volume on our White Cliffs NGL Pipeline; partially offset by
•an increase of $65 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $24 million increase in employee costs, a $17 million increase resulting from the timing of project related expenses, a $15 million increase in outside services expenses, a $13 million increase in ad valorem taxes and increases totaling $13 million from various other operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by an $18 million decrease in gas and power utility costs; and
•an increase of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased costs from recently acquired assets.

The investment in USAC segment reflects the consolidated results of USAC.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our investment in USAC segment increased due to the net impact of the following:
•an increase of $95 million in segment margin primarily due to higher revenue-generating horsepower as a result of increased demand for compression services, higher market-based rates on newly deployed and redeployed compression units and higher average rates on existing customer contracts; partially offset by
•an increase of $19 million in operating expenses primarily due to an increase in employee costs associated with increased revenue-generating horsepower; and
•an increase of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in professional fees.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased due to the net impact of the following:
•a decrease of $42 million primarily due to intersegment eliminations of Sunoco LP’s 32.5% share of the ET-S Permian joint venture, which is consolidated in our crude oil transportation and services segment and also reflected as an unconsolidated affiliate in our investment in Sunoco LP segment, partially offset by higher acquisition costs in 2023 related to the Lotus Midstream and Crestwood acquisitions;
•a decrease of $9 million due to favorable results from our captive insurance company in the prior year; and
•a decrease of $5 million from our dual drive compression business due to lower gas prices; partially offset by
•an increase of $45 million in our natural gas marketing business due to increased residue sales resulting from the integration of the recently acquired WTG Midstream assets, as well as higher gains from storage positions.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our ability to satisfy our obligations and pay distributions to Unitholders will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business, weather conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond management’s control. The significant trends and uncertainties that we currently believe could significantly impact our liquidity and cash flows going forward are discussed in “Trends and Outlook” above. 
We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and sources of funding to meet our cash requirements over the near term and for the longer term. We expect to satisfy our working capital needs through cash generated by our operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $312 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $2.21 billion. 
The Partnership’s material contractual obligations include long-term debt service, payments under operating leases and purchase commitments. The Partnership’s obligations under its long-term debt agreements are described below under “Description of Indebtedness,” and information on the maturities and interest rates related to the Partnership’s long-term debt is available in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, information on the Partnership’s obligations under its lease arrangements is included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We define a purchase commitment as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are

established at the inception of the contract. We have material purchase commitments for crude oil; as of December 31, 2024, those purchase commitments totaled an estimated $50.34 billion (of which $22.45 billion would be due in 2025) based on either the current market price for variable price contracts or the contracted price for fixed price contracts. 
We currently expect capital expenditures in 2025 to be approximately as follows (including capitalized interest and overhead, but excluding capital expenditures related to our investments in Sunoco LP and USAC):

                                                                       Growth                Maintenance

(1)Includes capital expenditures related to the Partnership’s proportionate ownership of the Bakken, Rover and Bayou Bridge pipeline joint ventures as well as the Orbit Gulf Coast NGL Exports joint venture. 
The assets used in our natural gas and liquids operations, including pipelines, gathering systems and related facilities, are generally long-lived assets and do not require significant maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not have any significant financial commitments for maintenance capital expenditures in our businesses. From time to time, we experience increases in pipe costs due to a number of reasons, including but not limited to, delays from steel mills, limited selection of mills capable of producing large diameter pipe timely, higher steel prices and other factors beyond our control. However, we include these factors in our anticipated growth capital expenditures for each year.
We generally fund maintenance capital expenditures and distributions with cash flows from operating activities. We generally expect to funds growth capital expenditures with proceeds of borrowings under our credit facilities, along with cash from operations.
Sunoco LP expects to invest at least $400 million in growth capital expenditures and approximately $150 million in maintenance capital expenditures in 2025. 
USAC currently has budgeted between $38 million and $42 million in maintenance capital expenditures and currently has budgeted between $120 million and $140 million in expansion capital expenditures in 2025.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price of our products and services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, the successful integration of our acquisitions and other factors.
Operating Activities
Changes in cash flows from operating activities between periods primarily result from changes in earnings (as discussed in “Results of Operations” above), excluding the impacts of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include recurring non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and non-cash compensation expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the periods presented primarily resulted from construction and acquisitions of assets, while changes in non-cash compensation expense resulted from changes in the number of units granted and changes in the grant date fair value for such grants. Cash flows from operating activities also differ from earnings as a result of non-cash charges that may not be recurring such as impairment charges and allowance for equity funds used during construction. The allowance for equity funds used during construction increases in periods when Energy Transfer has a significant amount of interstate pipeline construction in progress. Changes in operating assets and liabilities between periods result from factors such as the changes in the value of derivative assets and liabilities, timing of accounts receivable collection, payments on accounts payable, the timing of purchases and sales of inventories, and the timing of advances and deposits received from customers.

Financing Activities
Changes in cash flows from financing activities between periods primarily result from changes in the levels of borrowings and equity issuances, which are primarily used to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. Distributions to partners increased between the periods as a result of increases in the number of common units outstanding or increases in the distribution rate.
Following is a summary of financing activities by period:
Year Ended December 31, 2024
Cash used in financing activities was $5.45 billion in 2024. In 2024, we had a net increase in our debt level of $4.74 billion. During 2024, we paid distributions of $4.62 billion to our partners, we paid distributions of $1.78 billion to noncontrolling interests and we paid distributions of $67 million to our redeemable noncontrolling interests. In 2024, we paid $2.65 billion in cash for the redemption of our Series A, Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Units and we paid $37 million in cash to redeem a portion of the outstanding Crestwood Niobrara LLC preferred units.

Covenants Related to Our Credit Agreements
The agreements relating to the senior notes contain restrictive covenants customary for an issuer with an investment-grade rating from the rating agencies, which covenants include limitations on liens and a restriction on sale-leaseback transactions.
The Five-Year Credit Facility contains covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) the Partnership’s and certain of the Partnership’s subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:
•incur indebtedness;

•engage in business substantially different in nature than the business currently conducted by the Partnership and its subsidiaries;
•engage in transactions with affiliates; and
•enter into restrictive agreements.
The applicable margin and rate used in connection with the interest rates and commitment fees, respectively, are based on the credit ratings assigned to our senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. The applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans under the Five-Year Credit Facility ranges from 1.125% to 2.000% and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.125% to 1.000%.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules, and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. For further details on our accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the accrual for and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The natural gas industry conducts its business by processing actual transactions at the end of the month following the month of delivery. Consequently, the most current month’s financial results are estimated using volume estimates and market prices for our intrastate transportation and storage segment, our midstream segment, and our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment. Any differences between estimated results and actual results are recognized in the following month’s financial statements. Management believes that the operating results estimated for the year ended December 31, 2024 represent the actual results in all material respects.
Some of the other significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the timing of certain forecasted transactions that are hedged, the fair value of derivative instruments, useful lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization, purchase accounting allocations and subsequent realizability of intangible assets, fair value measurements used in the goodwill impairment test, market value of inventory, assets and liabilities resulting from the regulated ratemaking process, contingency reserves and environmental reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value Estimates in Business Combination Accounting and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Business combination accounting and quantitative impairment testing are required from time to time due to the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances, or annual testing requirements. For business combinations, assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value in connection with the initial recognition of the transaction. For impairment testing, long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired. An impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is recognized when circumstances indicate that a decline in the investment value is other than temporary. An impairment loss 
Index to Financial Statements

should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset/goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Calculating the fair value of assets or reporting units in connection with business combination accounting or impairment testing requires management to make several estimates, assumptions and judgements, and in some circumstances management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those calculations.
In order to allocate the purchase price in a business combination or to test for recoverability when performing a quantitative impairment test, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, we make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located, the availability and prices of commodities, our ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements, the risks that exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful, our dependence on certain significant customers and producers, and competition from other companies, including major energy producers. While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to calculate the fair value, if future results are not consistent with our estimates, we could be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
The Partnership determines the fair value of its assets and/or reporting units using the discounted cash flow method, the guideline company method, the reproduction and replacement methods, or a weighted combination of these methods. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. The Partnership believes the estimates and assumptions used in our business combination accounting and impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, the Partnership determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit including estimates for capital expenditures, discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted industry rate, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit. Cash flow projections are derived from one year budgeted amounts and five year operating forecasts plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur. Under the guideline company method, the Partnership determines the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using a multi-year average. In addition, the Partnership estimates a reasonable control premium, when appropriate, representing the incremental value that accrues to the majority owner from the opportunity to dictate the strategic and operational actions of the business. Under the reproduction and replacement methods, the Partnership determines the fair value of assets based on the estimated installation, engineering, and set-up costs related to the asset; these methods require the use of trend factors, such as inflation indices.
One key assumption in these fair value calculations is management’s estimate of future cash flows and EBITDA. In accounting for a business combination, these estimates are generally based on the forecasts that were used to analyze the deal economics. For impairment testing, these estimates are based on the annual budget for the upcoming year and forecasted amounts for multiple subsequent years. The annual budget process is typically completed near the annual goodwill impairment testing date, and management uses the most recent information for the annual impairment tests. The forecast is also subjected to a comprehensive update annually in conjunction with the annual budget process and is revised periodically to reflect new information and/or revised expectations. The estimates of future cash flows and EBITDA are subjective in nature and are subject to impacts from the business risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for business combination accounting and impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period. Such changes in fair value estimates could result in changes to the fair value estimates used in business combination accounting, which could significantly impact results of operations in a period subsequent to the business combination, depending on multiple factors, including the timing of such changes. In the case of impairment testing, such changes could result in additional impairments in future periods; therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur in a given period, resulting in additional impairments.
In addition, we may change our method of impairment testing, including changing the weight assigned to different valuation models. Such changes could be driven by various factors, including the level of precision or availability of data for our assumptions. Any changes in the method of testing could also result in an impairment or impact the magnitude of an impairment.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Partnership recorded total assets of approximately $11.36 billion, $9.71 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively, in connection with business combinations.
Index to Financial Statements

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Partnership recorded impairments totaling $52 million, $12 million and $386 million, respectively. Additional information on the impairments recorded during these periods is available in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets. Depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets is provided using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives. Changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on our results of operation. The Partnership’s results of operations have not been significantly impacted by changes in the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets during the periods presented, and we do not anticipate any such significant changes in the future. However, changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to change the estimated useful lives of the assets, which could significantly impact the Partnership’s results of operations. Additional information on our accounting policies and the estimated useful lives associated with our long-lived assets is available in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Legal and Regulatory Matters. We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from claims, orders, judgments or settlements. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. We expense legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are revised, as required, as better information becomes available to us. The factors we consider when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of our legal counsel; (ii) our previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accruals of $281 million and $285 million, respectively, were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets related to these contingent obligations.
For more information on our litigation and contingencies, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this annual report.
Environmental Remediation Activities. The Partnership’s accrual for environmental remediation activities reflects anticipated work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The accrual for known claims is undiscounted and is based on currently available information, estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. It is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations, changing technologies and their associated costs, and changes in the economic environment. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities. 
Losses attributable to unasserted claims are generally reflected in the accruals on an undiscounted basis, to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We have established a wholly owned captive insurance company to bear certain risks associated with environmental obligations related to certain sites that are no longer operating. The premiums paid to the captive insurance company include estimates for environmental claims that have been incurred but not reported, based on an actuarially determined fully developed claims expense estimate. In such cases, we accrue losses attributable to unasserted claims based on the discounted estimates that are used to develop the premiums paid to the captive insurance company.
In general, each remediation site/issue is evaluated individually based upon information available for the site/issue and no pooling or statistical analysis is used to evaluate an aggregate risk for a group of similar items (e.g., service station sites) in determining the amount of probable loss accrual to be recorded. The Partnership’s estimates of environmental remediation costs also frequently involve evaluation of a range of estimates. In many cases, it is difficult to determine that one point in the range of loss estimates is more likely than any other. In these situations, existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued. Accordingly, the low end of the range often represents the amount of loss which has been recorded. The Partnership’s consolidated balance sheets reflected $278 million and $277 million in environmental accruals as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon, among other things, the identification of any additional sites, the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site, the timing and nature of required remedial actions, the nature of operations at each site, the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements, the nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the availability of insurance coverage, the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations, inflation rates, terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of the Partnership’s liability at the sites, if any, in light of the number, participation level and financial viability of the other parties. The recognition of additional losses, if and when they were to occur, would likely extend over many years. Management believes that the Partnership’s exposure to

adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material. However, if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur or the assumptions used to estimate losses at multiple sites are adjusted, such changes could impact multiple facilities, formerly owned facilities and third-party sites at the same time. As a result, from time to time, significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur; however, management does not believe that any such charges would have a material adverse impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial position.
Deferred Income Taxes. Energy Transfer recognizes benefits in earnings and related deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and tax credit carryforwards. If necessary, a charge to earnings and a related valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized by the Partnership in the future. Deferred income tax assets attributable to state and federal NOLs and federal excess business interest expense carryforwards totaling $197 million have been included in Energy Transfer’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The state NOL carryforward benefits of $81 million ($64 million net of federal benefit) began expiring in 2024 with a substantial portion expiring between 2033 and 2039. Energy Transfer’s corporate subsidiaries have federal NOLs of $537 million ($113 million in benefits), all of which was generated in 2018 or later. A total of $341 million of the federal net operating loss carryforward is limited under IRC §382. Although we expect to fully utilize the IRC §382 limited federal net operating loss, the amount utilized in a particular year may be limited. Any federal NOL generated in 2018 and future years can be carried forward indefinitely. A foreign subsidiary of Sunoco LP had a net operating loss of $56 million ($15 million in benefits) which can be carried forward indefinitely. In making the assessment of the future realization of the deferred tax assets, we rely on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income based on historical and projected future operating results. The potential need for valuation allowances is regularly reviewed by management. If it is more likely than not that the recorded asset will not be realized, additional valuation allowances which increase income tax expense may be recognized in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made.
