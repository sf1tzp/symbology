## Management Commentary

Energy Transfer’s management team is focused on executing a growth strategy centered around expanding its natural gas and liquids businesses through strategic investments in infrastructure and acquisitions. The company’s strategy is predicated on a belief that it can generate sufficient cash flow to support distributions to Unitholders. However, management acknowledges that this strategy is subject to significant risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in regulatory policies, and broader economic conditions.
