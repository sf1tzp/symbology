## General Motors Company and Subsidiaries – Report

## General Sentiment

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is incorporated by reference into this MD&A.

## Management Commentary

We face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, rising material prices, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. As a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point.

## Challenges and Risks

The most significant factors that influence our automotive sales volume, which is a key indicator of our performance, are the unique technological, operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to the timing and commercialization of autonomous vehicles.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles.

## Noteworthy Extras

GM Financial’s primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and interest cost. GM Financial’s primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, and operating expenses.

## Operational Results

In the year ended December 31, 2019, net automotive cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to a decrease in net collateral posted for derivative positions of $0.8 billion, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.
