**Management Commentary**

General Motors Company and its subsidiaries are committed to delivering a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. This vision guides our growth-focused strategy, which includes investing in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions, and new business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We will execute our strategy with a diverse team and a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.

**Challenges and Risks**

*   The success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control.
*   The potential for climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events.
