General Motors Co 2023 10-K Section 7 summarized by 10-k Section 7 Summarize 4 @ (0.0)


## General Sentiment

Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We will adapt to customer preferences while executing our growth-focused strategy to invest in EVs, hybrids, AVs, software-enabled services and other new business opportunities. To support strong margins and cash flow during this transition, we are strengthening our market position in profitable ICE vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We plan to execute our strategy with a steadfast commitment to good corporate citizenship through more sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.

## Management Commentary

In the year ended December 31, 2023, our performance was driven by the success of high-margin products like full-size pick-ups and SUVs, despite several headwinds, including higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, supply chain and logistics challenges, and work stoppages associated with recent labor negotiations. This performance was due to the strength of our vehicle portfolio, strong consumer demand and execution of our core business strategy, focused on fixed cost reduction and pricing discipline. In January 2023, we announced our intention to implement a cost reduction program to reduce automotive fixed costs by $2.0 billion on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2024. This goal includes the impact of higher expected depreciation and amortization expense and inflationary cost increases on fixed cost but excludes changes in our pension income. In March 2023, we announced performance-based exits and a voluntary separation program (VSP) in an effort to accelerate attrition, which we believe will result in approximately $1.0 billion towards this target on an annual run rate basis. In addition to people costs, we are reducing our marketing and advertising expenses, streamlining our engineering expense by reducing complexity across the vehicle portfolio, adjusting the cadence of our EV launches due to customer demand, reducing launch-related expenses in the near-term, reprioritizing growth initiatives and reducing our overall overhead and discretionary costs.  Beginning in 2024 and through the end of the term of the Labor Agreement, GM will offer three separate cash severance incentive programs to UAW-represented employees that meet the normal or early retirement eligibility requirements.  We also anticipate that we will continue to evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet.

## Challenges and Risks

The key challenges and risks facing GM include: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer needs and preferences; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a strategic portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of incentives, and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (5) the unique technological, operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to the timing and commercialization of AVs, including the various regulatory approvals and permits required for operating driverless AVs in multiple markets; (6) risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events; (7) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (8) inflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of raw materials and commodities used by us and our suppliers, and instability in logistics and related costs; (9) foreign exchange volatility; (10) evolving trade policy and political uncertainty; (11) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (12) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (13) pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises; (14) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (15) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (16) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

Our risk mitigation strategy includes implementing a cost reduction program to reduce automotive fixed costs by $2.0 billion on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2024, which includes the impact of higher expected depreciation and amortization expense and inflationary cost increases on fixed cost but excludes changes in our pension income. We also announced performance-based exits and a voluntary separation program (VSP) in an effort to accelerate attrition, which we believe will result in approximately $1.0 billion towards this target on an annual run rate basis. In addition to people costs, we are reducing our marketing and advertising expenses, streamlining our engineering expense by reducing complexity across the vehicle portfolio, adjusting the cadence of our EV launches due to customer demand, reducing launch-related expenses in the near-term, reprioritizing growth initiatives and reducing our overall overhead and discretionary costs.
