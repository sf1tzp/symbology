Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward‑looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward‑Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10‑K.
Overview
Kosmos is a full-cycle deepwater independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused along the Atlantic Margins. Our key assets include production offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as a world-class gas development offshore Mauritania and Senegal. We also maintain a sustainable exploration program balanced between proven basin infrastructure-led exploration (Equatorial Guinea and U.S. Gulf of Mexico), emerging basins (Mauritania, Senegal and Suriname) and frontier basins (Cote d'Ivoire, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, and South Africa). 
Recent Developments
Corporate
During April 2019, the Company issued $650 million of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2026 and received net proceeds of approximately $640.0 million after deducting commission and deferred financing costs. We used the net proceeds to fund the redemption of our 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2021, of which there was a $525 million aggregate principal amount outstanding, to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Corporate Revolver and to pay fees and expenses related to the redemption, repayment and the offering.
Ghana
Jubilee

During the year ended December 31, 2019, Jubilee production averaged approximately 87,400 Bopd (gross), as one new producer well came online. During the first quarter of 2019, gas reliability issues were worked on by the operator with the reliability of the gas system enhanced by having a spare high-pressure compressor made available. However, oil production rates remain constrained by gas handling capabilities. Work to enhance gas handling capacity has been deferred by the operator to first quarter of 2020. 
TEN
During the year ended December 31, 2019, TEN production averaged approximately 61,100 Bopd (gross) as one new producer well at Enyenra came online. During the second quarter of 2019, the completion of the Enyenra-14 production well was deferred due to operational issues. As a result, the accompanying Enyenra-16 water injection well was also deferred.
U.S. Gulf of Mexico
During the year ended December 31, 2019, U.S. Gulf of Mexico production averaged approximately 24,100 Boepd (net) (~82% oil).
During the first quarter of 2019, the Helix Producer I, the facility that supports production from the Company’s Tornado field, completed its planned, regulatory-required dry-dock period. After approximately two months of downtime, production from the Tornado wells re-commenced as scheduled. Early in the second quarter of 2019, the Tornado-3 development well located in Green Canyon block 281 (35.0% working interest) came online. 
During the first quarter of 2019, Kosmos farmed-into 18 BP-owned blocks in the Garden Banks area of the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Kosmos can earn an interest in three BP blocks in other areas of the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This should allow Kosmos to execute projects that can be tied back to existing infrastructure. Kosmos is the designated operator and drilled the first well in Garden Banks block 492 (Kosmos 50%, BP 50%), the Resolution exploration well, in November 2019. The well encountered reservoir quality sands; however, the primary exploration objective proved to be water bearing. The well was plugged and abandoned and the well results are being integrated into the ongoing evaluation of the surrounding area.
During the first quarter of 2019, Kosmos executed a farm-in agreement with Chevron covering the right to earn an interest in Mississippi Canyon block 728 in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This agreement allows Kosmos another opportunity to execute its deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico strategy of infrastructure-led exploration. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Kosmos then entered into a cross assignment of our interest in Mississippi Canyon block 728 with Hess Corporation on their interest in an adjacent block, Mississippi Canyon block 684, after which Kosmos now has a 40% interest in the two blocks, and Hess Corporation has a 60% interest. Kosmos is the designated operator and drilled the first well in Mississippi Canyon block 728, the Oldfield exploration well, in December 2019. The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned in the first quarter of 2020.
In the second quarter of 2019, we announced the Gladden Deep exploration well located in Mississippi Canyon Block 800 (20.0% working interest) made an oil discovery. Gladden Deep is a subsea tieback that was brought online in September 2019 through the existing Gladden pipeline to the Medusa SPAR. 
In October 2019, we drilled the Moneypenny prospect, which was unsuccessful. The well was designed as an inexpensive exploration tail of an Odd Job development well. 
Kosmos participated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Federal Lease Sales 252 and 253 and was ultimately awarded 13 deepwater blocks during 2019. As part of the Company's strategy to expand its position in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, these new leases have added significant infrastructure-led exploration prospects to our portfolio. 

Equatorial Guinea

Effective January 1, 2019, our outstanding shares in KTIPI were transferred to Trident in exchange for a 40.4% undivided interest in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. As a result, our interest in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex will be accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting going forward. Pre-tax income from our interests in our Ceiba Field and Okume Complex are taxable in Equatorial Guinea at a 35% statutory tax rate, which will impact our overall effective tax rate. 
Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 38,300 Bopd (gross) for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our ESP program is supporting field production with five ESPs completed during the year ended December 31, 2019.
In March 2019, we acquired Ophir's remaining interest in Block EG-24 offshore Equatorial Guinea, which resulted in Kosmos owning an 80% participating interest and operatorship in the block.
In October 2019, the S-5 exploration well was drilled to a total depth of 4,400 meters offshore Equatorial Guinea, encountering 39 meters of net oil pay in good-quality Santonian reservoir. The well is located within tieback range of the Ceiba FPSO and work is currently ongoing to establish the scale of the discovered resource and evaluate the optimum development solution. 
Mauritania and Senegal
Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit
In February 2019, to optimize resource recovery in this field, we entered into the GTA UUOA with the governments of Mauritania and Senegal. The GTA UUOA governs interests in and development of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field and created the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit from portions of the Mauritania Block C8 and the Senegal Saint Louis Offshore Profond Block areas. Mauritania and Senegal each issued an exploitation authorization for the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit area covered by the GTA UUOA. Kosmos and BP signed Carry Advance Agreements with the national oil companies of Mauritania and Senegal, which obligate us separately to finance the respective national oil company’s share of certain development costs incurred through first gas for Phase 1, currently projected in the first half of 2022. Kosmos’ total share for the two agreements combined is up to $239.7 million, which is to be repaid with interest through the national oil companies’ share of future revenues.
In April 2019, KBR was awarded the Pre-FEED services contract for Phases 2 and 3 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project. These next phases are expected to expand capacity of this hub to approximately 10 MMTPA of LNG for export.
During the second quarter of 2019, the national oil companies in Mauritania and Senegal elected to increase their respective interest in their portion of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit to the maximum allowed percentages under the respective petroleum contracts. After the election, our interest in the exploration areas of Block C8 offshore Mauritania and in Saint Louis Offshore Profound offshore Senegal are unchanged, however, our interest in the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit is now 26.7%. 
In the second quarter of 2019, we withdrew from Block C18 offshore Mauritania and we entered into the second exploration phase on blocks C8 and C12 offshore Mauritania, each of which expire in June 2022. Block C12 contains a one well drilling commitment.
In July 2019, we announced the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim-1 (GTA-1) appraisal well was drilled on the eastern anticline within the unit development area of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim field. The GTA-1 well encountered approximately 30 meters of net gas pay in high quality Albian reservoir. The well was drilled in approximately 2,500 meters of water, approximately 10 kilometers inboard of the Guembeul-1A and Tortue-1 wells, to a total depth of 4,884 meters. 
Senegal 

In September 2019, we announced the Yakaar-2 appraisal well was drilled approximately nine kilometers from the Yakaar-1 exploration well and further delineated the southern extension of the field. The Yakaar-2 well encountered approximately 30 meters of net gas pay in similar high-quality Cenomanian reservoir to the Yakaar-1 exploration well. The Yakaar-2 well was drilled in approximately 2,500 meters of water to a total depth of approximately 4,800 meters. The Yakaar and Teranga discoveries are being analyzed as a joint development. 
Mauritania
In October 2019, we announced the Orca-1 exploration well, located in Block C-8 offshore Mauritania, made a major gas discovery. The Orca-1 well, which targeted a previously untested Albian play, encountered 36 meters of net gas pay in excellent quality reservoirs. In addition, the well extended the Cenomanian play fairway by confirming 11 meters of net gas pay in a down-structure position relative to the original Marsouin-1 discovery well. The location of the Orca-1 proved the structural and stratigraphic trap. The Orca-1 well was drilled in approximately 2,510 meters of water to a total measured depth of around 5,266 meters. The Bir Allah and Orca discoveries are being analyzed as a joint development. 
Sao Tome and Principe
In May 2019, we entered into the second exploration phase on Block 5 offshore Sao Tome and Principe, which contains a one well drilling commitment and expires in May 2021. Galp provided notice of withdrawal at the same time, resulting in an increase in Kosmos participating interest from 45% to 58.8%.
In July 2019, the petroleum contract for Block 11 offshore Sao Tome and Principe was amended to remove any well commitment from the second exploration phase and add a contingent well to the third exploration phase in addition to the existing firm well. We also entered the second exploration phase, which will expire in July 2021.
In November 2019, we entered the second exploration phase of Block 6 offshore Sao Tome and Principe, which will expire in November 2021. We plan to drill an exploration well on Block 6 offshore Sao Tome and Principle, as technical operator of the well, in late 2020. 
In November 2019, we completed a farm-out agreement with Shell Sao Tome and Principe B.V. to farmout a 20% participating interest in Block 6 and a 30% participating interest in Block 11, offshore Sao Tome and Principe resulting in our participating interests in Block 6 and 11 being 25% and 35%, respectively. A gain of $10.5 million was recognized as a result of the farm-out. 
In December 2019, a formal withdrawal notice from Block 12 offshore Sao Tome and Principe was communicated to partners with and effective date of January 31, 2020.
Namibia
In the second quarter of 2019, we received government approval to enter the second renewal period on Block PEL039 offshore Namibia, which contains a one well drilling commitment. We also received a one year extension to the phase, resulting in a three year period ending in August 2022.
Republic of the Congo
In March 2019, we entered into a petroleum contract covering the offshore Marine XXI block with the Republic of the Congo, subject to governmental approvals. Upon approval, we will hold an 85% participating interest and be the operator. The Congolese national oil company, SPNC, has a 15% carried participating interest during the exploration period. Should a commercial discovery be made, SNPC's 15% carried interest will convert to a participating interest of at least 15%. The petroleum contract covers approximately 2,350 square kilometers, with a first exploration period of four years and includes a work program to acquire and interpret 2,200 square kilometers of 3D seismic. There are two optional exploration phases, each for a period of three years, which are subject to additional work program commitments.
Republic of South Africa
In September 2019, we completed a farm-in agreement with OK Energy to acquire a 45% non-operated interest in the Northern Cape Ultra Deep Block offshore the Republic of South Africa. Shell owns 45% of the Block and is the operator and OK 
Energy retained 10%. The petroleum contract covers approximately 6,930 square kilometers at water depths ranging from 2,500 to 3,100 meters. The current exploration phase began in January 2019 and lasts for two years.

The results of operations for our equity method investments are presented in "Gain on equity method investments, net." See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Equity Method Investments" for additional information regarding our equity method investments.
Oil and gas revenue. Oil and gas revenue increased by $612.8 million as a result of the inclusion of a full year of revenue from our U.S. Gulf of Mexico business unit for the period ended December 31, 2019 related to the DGE acquisition, versus 108 days of revenue in the previous year's period. The current year period also benefited from the inclusion of revenue from Equatorial Guinea on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. The revenue increase from higher sales volumes was impacted by lower oil prices during the year ended December 31, 2019. We sold 23,331 MBbl at an average realized price per barrel of $63.25 in 2019 and 12,673 MBbl at an average realized price per barrel of $69.00 in 2018.
Gain on sale of assets. In November 2019, we closed a farm-out agreement with Shell for Blocks 6 and 11 offshore Sao Tome and Principe. As part of the transaction, we received proceeds in excess of our book basis resulting in a gain of $10.5 million. In August 2018, we closed a farm-out agreement with Trident covering blocks S, W and EG-21 offshore Equatorial Guinea. As part of the transaction, we received proceeds in excess of our book basis resulting in a gain of $7.7 million.
Other income. Other income, net decreased by $8.1 million as we recognized a gain of $8.0 million in 2018 on the exit of the Essaouira Offshore block, located offshore Morocco.
Oil and gas production. Oil and gas production costs increased by $177.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This is a result of the inclusion of a full year of oil and gas production costs from our U.S. Gulf of Mexico business unit for the period ended December 31, 2019 related to the DGE acquisition, versus 108 days of costs in the previous year's period. The current year was also impacted by the inclusion of production costs from 
Equatorial Guinea on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment.
Facilities insurance modifications, net. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $47.2 million of facilities insurance modification costs associated with the long-term solution to the Jubilee turret bearing issue versus $50.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these costs were offset by $71.5 million of hull and machinery insurance proceeds in 2019 as a result of final settlement of the insurance claim and $43.2 million in 2018.
Exploration expenses. Exploration expenses decreased by $120.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded lower unsuccessful well costs of $81.3 million primarily related to U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling versus the 2018 period costs of $123.2 million primarily related to Suriname drilling and the Wawa-1 and Akasa-1 exploration wells in Ghana, which were previously capitalized as suspended well costs. Additionally, seismic acquisition costs decreased $89.1 million versus the prior period primarily related to activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
General and administrative. General and administrative costs increased by $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily a result of having a full year of general and administrative costs from our U.S. Gulf of Mexico business unit during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the DGE acquisition, versus 108 days of costs in the previous year's period.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization. Depletion, depreciation and amortization increased $234.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily a result of a full year of depletion and amortization costs associated with the acquired U.S. Gulf of Mexico business unit and the inclusion of the Equatorial Guinea business unit, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment.
Interest and other financing costs, net. Interest and other financing costs, net increased by $53.9 million primarily a result of an increase in interest expense from an increased outstanding debt balance, the result of the DGE acquisition during the third quarter of 2018, and a $24.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt primarily associated with the refinancing of our senior secured notes recorded during the second quarter of 2019. 
Derivatives, net. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a loss of $71.9 million and a gain of $31.4 million, respectively, on our outstanding hedge positions. The gain and loss recorded were a result of changes in the forward curve of oil prices during the respective periods.
Gain on equity method investments, net. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we recognized a $72.9 million gain on our equity method investment in KTIPI. Effective January 1, 2019, our equity method investment in KTIPI was exchanged for a direct interest in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex, which was accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other expenses, net. Other expenses, net increased $31.1 million primarily related to $11.5 million in restructuring charges for employee severance and related benefit costs incurred as part of a corporate reorganization and an $8.7 million indirect tax settlement with tax authorities in Senegal during the year ended December 31, 2019, versus a credit resulting from the recovery of disputed charges of $12.9 million related to the arbitration against Tullow Ghana during 2018.
Income tax expense (benefit). For the year ended December 31, 2019, our overall effective tax rate was impacted by the difference in our 21% U.S. income tax reporting rate and the 35% statutory tax rates applicable to our Ghanaian and Equatorial Guinean operations, non-deductible and non-taxable items associated with our U.S., Ghanaian, and Equatorial Guinean operations, and other losses and expenses, primarily related to exploration operations in tax-exempt jurisdictions or in taxable jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and therefore, we do not realize any tax benefit on such losses or expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our overall effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible and non-taxable items associated with our U.S. and Ghanaian operations and other losses and expenses, primarily related to exploration operations in tax-exempt jurisdictions or in taxable jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and therefore, we do not realize any tax benefit on such expenses or losses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are actively engaged in an ongoing process of anticipating and meeting our funding requirements related to our strategy as a full-cycle exploration and production company. We have historically met our funding requirements through cash flows generated from our operating activities and obtained additional funding from issuances of equity and debt, as well as partner carries. 
While we are presently in a strong financial position, commodity prices remain volatile and could negatively impact our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows to meet our funding requirements. To partially mitigate this price volatility, we maintain a hedging program. Our investment decisions are based on longer‑term commodity prices based on the nature of our projects and development plans. Also, BP has agreed to partially carry our exploration, appraisal and development program in Mauritania and Senegal up to a contractually agreed cap. Current commodity prices, combined with our hedging program, partner carries and our current liquidity position support our dividend and capital program for 2020.
As such, our 2020 capital budget is based on our exploitation and production plans for Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, our infrastructure-led exploration program in Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, our appraisal and development activities in our emerging basins and our basin opening exploration across the portfolio.
Our future financial condition and liquidity can be impacted by, among other factors, the success of our exploitation, exploration and appraisal drilling programs, the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, the reliability of our oil and gas production facilities, our ability to continuously export oil and gas, our ability to secure and maintain partners and their alignment with respect to capital plans, the actual cost of exploitation, exploration, appraisal and development of our oil and natural gas assets, and coverage of any claims under our insurance policies.
As part of the Facility amendment and restatement process in 2018, the lenders approved a redetermination, setting the total commitments under our Facility at $1.5 billion (effective February 22, 2018) which was increased to $1.7 billion (effective January 31, 2019) after the election to exercise $0.2 billion of additional commitments in the fourth quarter of 2018. The commitments were reduced by $100.0 million to $1.6 billion following the Senior Notes issuance in April 2019. The borrowing base calculation includes value related to the Jubilee, TEN, Ceiba and Okume fields.

Net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $628.2 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $260.5 million in 2018 and $236.6 million in 2017, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico business unit during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the DGE acquisition, which was completed during the third quarter of 2018. It is also the result of the inclusion of operations from Equatorial Guinea on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily a result of an increase in oil and gas revenue and a decrease in exploration expenses related to the stacked rig costs and rig option cancellation payment, both recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. These changes were offset by a lack of LOPI proceeds, an increase in unsuccessful well costs and an increase in payments related to derivative cash settlements. 
The following table presents our liquidity and financial position as of December 31, 2019:

Capital Expenditures and Investments
We expect to incur capital costs as we:

•   drill additional wells and execute exploitation activities in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico;
•execute infrastructure-led exploration efforts in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea;

•   execute appraisal and exploration activities in a number of our exploration license areas; and
•acquire and analyze seismic on existing licenses and purchase seismic over new prospective areas.
We have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the number of wells we plan to drill, our participating, paying and carried interests in our prospects including disproportionate payment amounts, the costs involved in developing or participating in the development of a prospect, the timing of third‑party projects, the availability of suitable equipment and qualified personnel and our cash flows from operations. We also evaluate potential corporate and asset acquisition opportunities to support and expand our asset portfolio which may impact our budget assumptions. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic, regulatory, environmental and competitive uncertainties, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if market conditions deteriorate; or one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our acquisition, exploration, appraisal, development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may decide to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain additional bank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations.
2020 Capital Program
We estimate we will spend approximately $325 - $375 million of capital, excluding amounts related to Mauritania and Senegal, for the year ending December 31, 2020. This capital expenditure budget consists of:

•   Approximately 40% related to exploitation and production optimization activities across our Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets

•   Approximately 50% related to our infrastructure-led exploration and development activities across Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico

•   Approximately 10% related to basin opening exploration efforts across our portfolio
In Mauritania and Senegal we estimate capital expenditures of $250 million based on our current ownership interest, net of any remaining BP carry amounts. We expect to fund this expenditure using proceeds and/or carries received from our farm-down process.
The ultimate amount of capital we will spend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and the success of our exploitation and drilling results among other factors. Our future financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by, among other factors, our level of production of oil and the prices we receive from the sale of oil, our ability to effectively hedge future production volumes, the success of our multi-faceted exploration and appraisal drilling programs, the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, our partners’ alignment with respect to capital plans, and the actual cost of exploitation, exploration, appraisal and development of our oil and natural gas assets, and coverage of any claims under our insurance policies.
Significant Sources of Capital
Facility
In February 2018, the Company amended and restated the Facility with a total commitment of $1.5 billion from a number of financial institutions with additional commitments up to $0.5 billion being available if the existing financial institutions increase their commitments or if commitments from new financial institutions are added. In November 2018, the Company exercised its option with existing financial institutions to provide the Company with an additional commitment of $100 million in the aggregate under the Facility. The borrowing base calculation includes value related to the Jubilee, TEN, Ceiba and Okume fields. The Facility supports our oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development programs and corporate activities. As part of the debt refinancing in February 2018, the repayment of borrowings under the existing facility attributable to financial institutions that did not participate in the amended Facility was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, and $4.1 million of existing unamortized debt issuance costs and deferred interest attributable to those participants was expensed in interest and other financing costs, net. As of December 31, 2019, we have $32.8 million of unamortized issuance costs related to the Facility, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the Facility. In December 2018, the Company entered into letter agreements with existing financial institutions, which provided the Company with an additional commitment of $100 million in the aggregate under the Facility effective January 31, 2019. This took the total commitments to $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019. The commitments were reduced by $100.0 million to $1.6 billion following the Senior Notes issuance in April 2019 and remain at $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2019, borrowings under the Facility totaled $1.4 billion and the undrawn availability under the Facility was $200.0 million, which includes the additional commitments as referenced above. 
Interest is the aggregate of the applicable margin (3.25% to 4.50%, depending on the length of time that has passed from the date the Facility was entered into) and LIBOR. Interest is payable on the last day of each interest period (and, if the interest period is longer than six months, on the dates falling at six-month intervals after the first day of the interest period). We pay commitment fees on the undrawn and unavailable portion of the total commitments, if any. Commitment fees are equal to 30% per annum of the then-applicable respective margin when a commitment is available for utilization and, equal to 20% per annum of the then-applicable respective margin when a commitment is not available for utilization. We recognize interest expense in accordance with ASC 835—Interest, which requires interest expense to be recognized using the effective interest method. We determined the effective interest rate based on the estimated level of borrowings under the Facility.
The Facility provides a revolving credit and letter of credit facility. The availability period for the revolving credit facility expires one month prior to the final maturity date. The letter of credit facility expires on the final maturity date. The available facility amount is subject to borrowing base constraints and, beginning on March 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings will be constrained by an amortization schedule. The Facility has a final maturity date of March 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2019, we had no letters of credit issued under the Facility.
We have the right to cancel all the undrawn commitments under the amended and restated Facility. The amount of funds available to be borrowed under the Facility, also known as the borrowing base amount, is determined each year on March 31. The 
borrowing base amount is based on the sum of the net present values of net cash flows and relevant capital expenditures reduced by certain percentages as well as value attributable to certain assets’ reserves and/or resources in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
If an event of default exists under the Facility, the lenders can accelerate the maturity and exercise other rights and remedies, including the enforcement of security granted pursuant to the Facility over certain assets held by our subsidiaries. The Facility contains customary cross default provisions.
We were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Facility as of September 30, 2019 (the most recent assessment date), which requires the maintenance of:

•   the field life cover ratio (as defined in the glossary), not less than 1.30x; and

•   the loan life cover ratio (as defined in the glossary), not less than 1.10x; and

•   the debt cover ratio (as defined in the glossary), not more than 3.5x; and

•   the interest cover ratio (as defined in the glossary), not less than 2.25x.
Corporate Revolver
In August 2018, we amended and restated the Corporate Revolver maintaining the borrowing capacity at $400.0 million, extending the maturity date from November 2018 to May 2022 and lowering the margin 100 basis points to 5%. This results in lower commitment fees on the undrawn portion of the total commitments, which is 30% per annum of the respective margin. The Corporate Revolver is available for general corporate purposes and for oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development programs. 
As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Corporate Revolver and the undrawn availability under the Corporate Revolver was $400.0 million.
Interest is the aggregate of the applicable margin (5.0%), LIBOR and mandatory cost (if any, as defined in the Corporate Revolver). Interest is payable on the last day of each interest period (and, if the interest period is longer than six months, on the dates falling at six‑month intervals after the first day of the interest period). We pay commitment fees on the undrawn portion of the total commitments. Commitment fees for the lenders are equal to 30% per annum of the respective margin when a commitment is available for utilization.
The Corporate Revolver expires on May 31, 2022. The available amount is not subject to borrowing base constraints. We have the right to cancel all the undrawn commitments under the Corporate Revolver. We are required to repay certain amounts due under the Corporate Revolver with sales of certain subsidiaries or sales of certain assets. If an event of default exists under the Corporate Revolver, the lenders can accelerate the maturity and exercise other rights and remedies, including the enforcement of security granted pursuant to the Corporate Revolver over certain assets held by us. The Corporate Revolver contains customary cross default provisions.
We were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Corporate Revolver as of September 30, 2019 (the most recent assessment date), which requires the maintenance of:

•   the debt cover ratio (as defined in the glossary), not more than 3.5x; and

•   the interest cover ratio (as defined in the glossary), not less than 2.25x.
The U.S. and many foreign economies continue to experience uncertainty driven by varying macroeconomic conditions. Although some of these economies have shown signs of improvement, macroeconomic recovery remains uneven. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in extreme volatility in credit, equity, and foreign currency markets, including the European sovereign debt markets and volatility in various other markets. If any of the financial institutions within our Facility or Corporate Revolver are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted. We actively monitor all of the financial institutions participating in our Facility and Corporate Revolver. None of the financial institutions have indicated to us that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on our monitoring activities, we currently believe our banks will be able to perform on their commitments.
Revolving Letter of Credit Facility
In July 2013, we entered into a revolving letter of credit facility agreement (“LC Facility”). The size of the LC Facility was $75.0 million, as amended in July 2015, with additional commitments up to $50.0 million being available if the existing lender 
increased its commitments or if commitments from new financial institutions were added. The LC Facility provides that we shall maintain cash collateral in an amount equal to at least 75% of all outstanding letters of credit under the LC Facility, provided that during the period of any breach of certain financial covenants, the required cash collateral amount shall increase to 100%.
In July 2016, we amended and restated the LC Facility, extending the maturity date to July 2019. Other amendments included increasing the margin from 0.5% to 0.8% per annum on amounts outstanding, adding a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate equal to 0.65% on the available commitment amount and providing for issuance fees to be payable to the lender per new issuance of a letter of credit. We may voluntarily cancel any commitments available under the LC Facility at any time. During the first quarter of 2017, the LC Facility size was increased to $115.0 million and in April 2017, we reduced the size of our LC Facility to $70 million. In February 2018, the LC Facility was increased to $73 million to facilitate the issuance of additional letters of credit. In July 2018 and December 2018, the LC Facility size was voluntarily reduced to $40.0 million and$20.0 million, respectively, based on the expiration of several large outstanding letters of credit. The LC Facility expired in July 2019, however, as of December 31, 2019, there were five outstanding letters of credit totaling $3.1 million under the LC Facility, which will remain outstanding until the respective letters of credit expire. The LC Facility contains customary cross default provisions.
In 2019, we issued two letters of credit totaling $20.4 million under a new letter of credit arrangement, which does not currently require cash collateral.
7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2021
In April 2019, all of the Senior Secured Notes were redeemed for $543.8 million, including accrued interest and the early redemption premium. The redemption resulted in a $22.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in Interest and other financing costs, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
7.125% Senior Notes due 2026
In April 2019, the Company issued $650.0 million of 7.125% Senior Notes (the "Senior Notes") and received net proceeds of approximately $640.0 million after deducting commissions and other expenses. We used the net proceeds to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes, repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Corporate Revolver and pay fees and expenses related to the redemption, repayment and the issuance of the Senior Notes.
The Senior Notes mature on April 4, 2026. We will pay interest in arrears on the Senior Notes each April 4 and October 4, commencing on October 4, 2019. The Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Kosmos Energy Ltd. and rank equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness (including all borrowings under the Corporate Revolver) and rank effectively junior in right of payment to all of its existing and future secured indebtedness (including all borrowings under the Facility). The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by certain subsidiaries owning the Company's Gulf of Mexico assets, and on a subordinated, unsecured basis by certain subsidiaries that guarantee the Facility. 
At any time prior to April 4, 2022, and subject to certain conditions, the Company may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Senior Notes with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.1% of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Additionally, at any time prior to April 4, 2022 the Company may, on any one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100%, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, and plus a “make-whole” premium. On or after April 4, 2022, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest:

Year                                                          Percentage
On or after April 4, 2022, but before April 4, 2023        103.6       %
On or after April 4, 2023, but before April 4, 2024        101.8       %
On or after April 4, 2024 and thereafter                   100.0       %
We may also redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time if changes in tax laws impose certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the Senior Notes at a price equal to the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued interest and additional amounts, if any, as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder after any withholding or deduction on payments of the Senior Notes will not be less than the amount such holder would have received if such taxes had not been withheld or deducted.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event as defined under the Senior Notes indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.
If we sell assets, under certain circumstances outlined in the Senior Notes indenture, we will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to purchase the Senior Notes at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Senior Notes indenture restricts our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, make investments or certain other restricted payments, sell assets, enter into agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us, enter into transactions with affiliates, or effect certain consolidations, mergers or amalgamations. These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. Certain of these covenants will be terminated if the Senior Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by both Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes by period the payments due for our estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:

______________________________________

(1)   Includes the scheduled maturities for the $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issued in April 2019 and borrowings under the Facility. The scheduled maturities of debt related to the Facility are based on, as of December 31, 2019, our level of borrowings and our estimated future available borrowing base commitment levels in future periods. Any increases or decreases in the level of borrowings or increases or decreases in the available borrowing base would impact the scheduled maturities of debt during the next five years and thereafter.

(2)   Based on outstanding borrowings as noted in (1) above and the LIBOR yield curves at the reporting date and commitment fees related to the Facility and Corporate Revolver and interest on the Senior Notes.

(3)   Primarily relates to corporate office and foreign office leases.

(4)   Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator and excludes commitments for exploration activities, including well commitments and seismic obligations, in our petroleum contracts. The Company's liabilities for asset retirement obligations associated with the dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties are not included. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding these liabilities.
We currently have a commitment to drill one exploration well in each of Sao Tome and Principe and Namibia and two exploration wells in Mauritania. In Sao Tome and Principe, we also have 3D seismic acquisition requirements of approximately 13,500 square kilometers. In South Africa, we have 2D seismic acquisition requirements of approximately 500 line kilometers.
In February 2019, Kosmos and BP signed Carry Advance Agreements with the national oil companies of Mauritania and Senegal, which obligate us separately to finance the respective national oil company’s share of certain development costs. Kosmos’ total share for the two agreements combined is up to $239.7 million, which is to be repaid through the national oil companies’ share of future revenues.
The following table presents maturities by expected debt maturity dates, the weighted-average interest rates expected to be paid on the Facility given current contractual terms and market conditions, and the debt’s estimated fair value. Weighted‑average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. This table does not take into account amortization of deferred financing costs.

(1)   The amounts included in the table represent principal maturities only. The scheduled maturities of debt are based on the level of borrowings and the available borrowing base as of December 31, 2019. Any increases or decreases in the level of borrowings or increases or decreases in the available borrowing base would impact the scheduled maturities of debt during the next five years and thereafter.

(2)   Based on outstanding borrowings as noted in (1) above and the LIBOR yield curves plus applicable margin at the reporting date. Excludes commitment fees related to the Facility and Corporate Revolver.
Off‑Balance Sheet Arrangements
We may enter into off‑balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off‑balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2019, our material off‑balance sheet arrangements and transactions include short-term operating leases and undrawn letters of credit. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Kosmos’ liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
This discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date the financial statements are available to be issued. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies are detailed in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Accounting Policies.” We have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenues on the volumes sold of hydrocarbons sold to a purchaser. The volumes sold may be more or less than the volumes to which we are entitled based on our ownership interest in the property. These differences result in a condition known in the industry as a production imbalance. A receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves on such property. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no oil and gas imbalances recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
Our oil and gas revenues are recognized when production has been sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, title has transferred and collectability is probable. Certain revenues are based on provisional price contracts which contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from oil sales at the spot price on the date of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated as a hedge, is 
marked to market through oil and gas revenue each period until the final settlement occurs, which generally is limited to the month after the sale.
Exploration and Development Costs. We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Costs of unproved properties are transferred to proved properties when a determination that proved reserves have been found. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying unproved properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred. If exploratory wells are determined to be commercially unsuccessful or dry holes, the applicable costs are expensed. Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized. Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and equipment and to lift crude oil and natural gas to the surface are expensed.
Receivables. Our receivables consist of joint interest billings, oil sales and other receivables. For our Ghana oil sales receivable, we require a letter of credit to be posted to secure the outstanding receivable. Receivables from joint interest owners are stated at amounts due, net of any allowances for doubtful accounts. We determine our allowance by considering the length of time past due, future net revenues of the debtor’s ownership interest in oil and natural gas properties we operate, and the owner’s ability to pay its obligation, among other things.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes as required by the ASC 740—Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal, state and international tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of changes in tax laws or tax rates, tax credits, and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize or utilize our deferred tax assets. If realization is not more likely than not, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in no benefit for the deferred tax amounts. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. If our estimates and judgments regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets change, the benefits associated with those deferred tax assets may increase or decrease in the period our estimates and judgments change. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of the deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of such allowances, if necessary.
ASC 740 provides a more‑likely‑than‑not standard in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is necessary after weighing all of the available evidence. When evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the following:

•   the status of our operations in the particular taxing jurisdiction, including whether we have commenced production from a commercial discovery;

•   whether a commercial discovery has resulted in significant proved reserves that have been independently verified;

•   the amounts and history of taxable income or losses in a particular jurisdiction;

•   projections of future income, including the sensitivity of such projections to changes in production volumes and prices;

•   the existence, or lack thereof, of statutory limitations on the period that net operating losses may be carried forward in a jurisdiction; and

•   the creation and timing of future income associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We utilize oil derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with our anticipated future oil production. These derivative contracts consist of collars, put options, call options and swaps. We have also previously used interest rate derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to our long‑term debt. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or a liabilities measured at fair value. We do not apply hedge accounting to our oil derivative contracts. 
Estimates of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. Reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion and assessment of impairment of our oil and natural gas properties. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering 
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. As additional proved reserves are discovered, reserve quantities and future cash flows will be estimated by independent petroleum consultants and prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the FASB. The accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of:

•   the engineering and geological interpretation of available data;

•   estimates of the amount and timing of future operating cost, production taxes, development cost and workover cost;

•   the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and

•   the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations. We account for asset retirement obligations as required by the ASC 410—Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. Under these standards, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a tangible long‑lived asset with an existing asset retirement obligation is acquired, a liability for that obligation shall be recognized at the asset’s acquisition date as if that obligation were incurred on that date. In addition, a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize the asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long‑lived asset by the same amount as the liability. We record increases in the discounted abandonment liability resulting from the passage of time in depletion, depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Additionally, asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.
Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.
Impairment of Long‑Lived Assets. We review our long‑lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. ASC 360—Property, Plant and Equipment requires an impairment loss to be recognized if the carrying amount of a long‑lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long‑lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability, whether in use or under development. An impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long‑lived asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to us are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
We believe the assumptions used in our undiscounted cash flow analysis to test for impairment are appropriate and result in a reasonable estimate of future cash flows. The undiscounted cash flows from the analysis exceeded the carrying amount of our long-lived assets. The most significant assumptions are the pricing and production estimates used in undiscounted cash flow analysis. Where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the assumptions, we assumed a hypothetical reduction in our production profile and lower pricing during the early years which still showed no impairment. If we experience further declines in oil pricing, increases in our estimated future expenditures or a decrease in our estimated production profile our long-lived assets could be at risk for impairment.
Consolidations / Equity Method of Accounting. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. They also include Kosmos’ share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Investments in corporate joint ventures, which we exercise significant influence over, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Equity method investments are integral to our operations. The other parties, who also have an equity interest in these companies, are independent third parties. Kosmos does not invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance sheet.
