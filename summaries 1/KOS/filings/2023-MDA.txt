Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward‑looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward‑Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10‑K.
Overview
Kosmos is a full-cycle, deepwater, independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused along the offshore Atlantic Margins. Our key assets include production offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as world-class gas projects offshore Mauritania and Senegal. We also pursue a proven basin exploration program in Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Globally, the impacts of Russia’s war in Ukraine, potential instability in the Middle East, a potential recession, inflationary pressures and other varying macroeconomic conditions has impacted supply and demand for oil and gas, which also resulted in significant variability in oil and gas prices. The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flows, capital investments, debt capacity and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on these commodity prices.
Recent Developments
Corporate
In September 2023, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding principal amount of the GoM Term Loan in the amount of $137.5 million plus accrued interest using cash on hand, constituting payment in full. The GoM Term Loan was subsequently terminated pursuant to, and subject to the terms of, the GoM Term Loan.
In September 2023, the Company amended the Facility to accede Kosmos Energy Ghana Investments and Kosmos Energy Ghana Holdings Limited, to the Facility as obligors. As a result, the additional interests in Jubilee and TEN that were acquired in the October 2021 acquisition of Anadarko WCTP are now included when calculating the borrowing base amount for the Facility.
In October 2023, the Company amended the Facility to modify the amortization schedule in order to reduce the number of repayment installments from seven to six equal installments, with the first repayment installment scheduled on October 1, 2024, rather than March 31, 2024. There was no change to the final maturity date or final repayment date.
Ghana
During the year ended December 31, 2023, Ghana production averaged approximately 118,200 Boepd gross (38,600 Boepd net). 
The phased development of the Jubilee Field continued during 2023 successfully bringing four production wells and two injection wells online which included three wells (two production wells and one injection well) as part of the successful startup of the Jubilee Southeast project. The Jubilee Southeast project also included the installation of a new subsea production manifold. The development drilling campaign is planned to continue in 2024. One new injection well and one new production well were brought online early in the first quarter of 2024. The partnership expects to bring an additional three wells online in 2024 including two production wells and one injection well before we expect the rig contract to end.
In connection with the approval of the Jubilee Phase 1 PoD in 2009, the Jubilee Field partners agreed to provide the first 200 Bcf of natural gas produced from the Jubilee Field Phase 1 development to the Government of Ghana at no cost. As of January 1, 2023, the Jubilee partners had fulfilled this commitment. From 2018 through 2022, approximately 19 Bcf of the first 200 Bcf of natural gas was substituted from the TEN Fields in order to maintain consistent gas volumes to shore for Ghana domestic power purposes. Commencing on January 1, 2023, the volume of approximately 19 Bcf of Jubilee gas (in restoration of the amount originally substituted from TEN) was sold to Ghana under the terms of the TAG GSA at $0.50 per MMBtu. During 2023, the Jubilee partners reached an interim agreement to sell Jubilee Field gas at a price of $2.95 per MMBtu to the Government of Ghana beyond the 19 Bcf from the Jubilee Field through May 2024 while the partners continue on-going discussions with the Government of Ghana regarding a long-term future gas sales agreement. During the second quarter of 2023, the operator submitted a draft amended plan of development for TEN, as well as a term sheet for a gas sales agreement covering future gas sales from both the Jubilee and TEN Fields, to the Government of Ghana. If the amended plan of 
development for TEN is delayed or not approved, it could lead to a curtailment or delay of investment and development activity in TEN.
U.S. Gulf of Mexico
During the year ended December 31, 2023, U.S. Gulf of Mexico production averaged approximately 15,400 Boepd (net) (~81% oil). 
The Kodiak #3 infill well located in Mississippi Canyon was brought online in April 2021. The well experienced production issues and was shut-in. In March 2022, the Company commenced operations to plug back and side-track the original Kodiak #3 infill well. The Kodiak-3ST well was brought online in early September 2022. Well results and initial production were in line with expectations, however well productivity declined through the end of the third quarter of 2022. Workover plans have been developed and are now expected to commence around the middle of 2024 given the better than forecast performance of the well in 2023.
The Winterfell development project continued to make good progress during 2023 with first oil for Phase 1A of the project targeted for early in the second quarter of 2024 with production from the first two wells. The Winterfell-3 well is expected to commence drilling later in 2024. The host facility production handling agreement and oil export agreements have been executed.
The Odd Job Field subsea pump installation project was approximately 90% complete as of the end of 2023 with an expected online date in the middle of 2024. The project is expected to sustain long-term production from the Odd Job Field. 
In July 2023, Kosmos spud the Tiberius infrastructure-led exploration prospect, which is located in Block 964 of Keathley Canyon (33% working interest) in the Outer Wilcox play. In October 2023, we announced the well encountered approximately 75 meters (250 feet) of net oil pay in the primary Wilcox target. Initial fluid and core analysis supports the production potential of the wells, with characteristics analogous with similar nearby discoveries in the Wilcox trend. We are now working with partners on development options for the discovery. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Kosmos was named the apparent high bidder on five blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 261, including three blocks nearby to our Tiberius discovery. 
Equatorial Guinea

Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 25,300 Bopd gross (8,800 Bopd net) for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
The 2023 Ceiba Field and Okume Complex development rig campaign commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023. The campaign initially completed one production well workover. However, as a result of safety issues with the drilling rig, the operator terminated the rig contract in early February 2024. The partnership is seeking to secure an alternative rig and drilling contractor to resume the work, which is planned to include the drilling of in-fill production wells in Block G and the Akeng Deep ILX prospect in Block S.
In February 2023, Kosmos entered into a petroleum contract covering Block EG-01 offshore Equatorial Guinea with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Kosmos holds a 24% non-operated participating interest in the block. Block EG-01 currently comprises approximately 59,400 acres (240 square kilometers), with a first exploration period of three years from the effective date (March 1, 2023).
In March 2023, we closed a farm-out agreement to sell a 6.0% participating interest in Block S offshore Equatorial Guinea. As a result of the farm-out agreement, Kosmos’ participating interest in Block S was reduced to 34.0%.
Mauritania and Senegal
Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit
Phase 1 of the Greater Tortue project continued to progress in 2023. The following milestones were achieved through the year-end and filing date: 
•Drilling: The operator has successfully drilled and completed all four wells with expected production capacity significantly higher than what is required for first gas.
•Hub Terminal: Construction work is complete, and handover to operations was completed in August 2023.
•Subsea: Significant progress has been made on the installation of the infield flowlines and subsea structures. Work re-commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023 with completion expected at the end of the second quarter of 2024. BP, on behalf of the partner group, has initiated the process under its agreement with the original subsea contractor to recover the losses incurred. The partnership will seek to recover the maximum recoverable damages in binding arbitration. We estimate Kosmos’ net share of the recoverable damages to be up to $160.0 million.
•FLNG: The FLNG construction was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the vessel arrived on location offshore Mauritania/Senegal in the first quarter of 2024. Hookup work is now underway.
•FPSO: The vessel is currently in a shipyard in Tenerife for inspection and repair of fairleads. Completion of this work and transit to the project site is expected early in the second quarter of 2024 ahead of final hookup and commissioning.
The critical path to first gas on Phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project, now targeted in the third quarter of 2024, continues to be through the arrival, hookup and commissioning of the FPSO. Timely execution of this workstream is expected to allow for first LNG in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
Yakaar and Teranga Discoveries 
The Yakaar and Teranga discoveries continue to be analyzed as a joint development. During 2023, we continued progressing appraisal studies, maturing concept design, and proposed to partners that the Yakaar and Teranga discoveries in the Cayar Offshore Profond Block be pursued as a commercial joint development. PETROSEN agreed to the proposal, however, BP decided not to participate in the development and exploitation of the Yakaar and Teranga discoveries. In accordance with the provisions of the Contract for Exploration and Production Sharing of Hydrocarbons for the Cayar Offshore Profond Block (the “Contract”) and the related Joint Operating Agreement (the “JOA”), BP has waived its rights in respect of the Yakaar and Teranga discoveries. As provided in the JOA, Kosmos has assumed BP’s participating interest under the Contract and the JOA and has become operator of the Cayar Offshore Profond Block, with customary government approvals having been received effective January 18, 2024. The participating interests in the Cayar Offshore Profond Block are now: Kosmos 90% and PETROSEN 10%, with PETROSEN having the right to increase its participating interest after issuance of an exploitation authorization to up to 35%.
Sao Tome and Principe
In the second quarter of 2023, we received approval for a twelve month extension to May 2024 for the current exploration phase for Block 5 offshore Sao Tome and Principe.

(1)Includes activity related to the pre-emption transaction with Tullow on March 13, 2022. 
Oil and gas revenue. Oil and gas revenue decreased by $543.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of lower average oil prices and lower oil production across our portfolio due to natural field decline, partially offset by increased natural gas sales in Ghana for the year ended December 31, 2023. We sold 23,057 MBoe at an average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent of $73.80 in 2023 and 23,117 MBoe at an average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent of $97.13 in 2022.
Gain on sale of assets. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we received $50.0 million from Shell under the terms of our 2020 farm-out agreement.
Oil and gas production. Oil and gas production costs decreased by $13.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of changes to the production mix across our portfolio.
Exploration expenses. Exploration expenses decreased by $92.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of the $64.2 million of previously capitalized costs related to the BirAllah and Orca discoveries incurred under the Block C8 license offshore Mauritania that were written off to exploration expense with the expiration of the exploration period of Block C8 during the year ended December 31, 2022, along with $13.7 million of exploration expense recorded in 2022 related to two abandoned Ntomme step out wells in Ghana.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization. Depletion, depreciation and amortization decreased $53.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of lower depletion per barrel in the current year resulting from a lower cost basis in our TEN Fields due to the impairment loss recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets decreased $227.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We recorded an impairment charge of $450.0 million 
in the year ended December 31, 2022 for the TEN Fields as a result of negative proved oil and gas reserve revisions. We recorded an additional impairment charge on the TEN Fields during 2023 of $222.3 million based on further negative revisions to proved oil and gas reserves associated with the TEN Fields. The additional revisions were primarily driven by a change in the partnership’s development work scope for the TEN Fields and well performance.
Interest and other financing costs, net. Interest and other financing costs, net decreased by $22.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of increased capitalized interest related to the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project partially offset by increased interest expenses related to higher interest rates.
Derivatives, net. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a loss of $11.1 million and $260.9 million, respectively, on our outstanding hedge positions. The changes recorded were a result of changes in the forward curve of oil prices during the respective periods.
Other expenses, net. Other expenses, net increased $32.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of approximately $7.4 million of inventory impairments and $7.5 million of other asset write downs in the year ended December 31, 2023 and $11.9 million of insurance proceeds in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Income tax expense (benefit). For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our overall effective tax rates were impacted by the difference in our 21% U.S. income tax reporting rate and the 35% statutory tax rates applicable to our Ghanaian and Equatorial Guinean operations, jurisdictions that have a 0% statutory tax rate, jurisdictions where we have incurred losses and have recorded valuation allowances against the corresponding deferred tax assets, and other non-deductible expenses, primarily in the U.S.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are actively engaged in an ongoing process of anticipating and meeting our funding requirements related to our strategy as a full-cycle exploration and production company. We have historically met our funding requirements through cash flows generated from our operating activities and obtained additional funding from issuances of equity and debt, as well as partner carries.
Oil prices are historically volatile and could negatively impact our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows to meet our funding requirements. This volatility could result in wide fluctuations in future oil prices, which could impact our ability to comply with our financial covenants. To partially mitigate this price volatility, we maintain an active hedging program and review our capital spending program on a regular basis. Our investment decisions are based on longer-term commodity prices based on the nature of our projects and development plans. Current commodity prices, combined with our hedging program and our current liquidity position is expected to support our capital program for 2024.
Our future financial condition and liquidity can be impacted by, among other factors, the success of our exploitation, exploration and appraisal drilling programs, the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, the reliability of our oil and gas production facilities, our ability to continuously export oil and gas, our ability to secure and maintain partners and their alignment with respect to capital plans, the actual cost of exploitation, exploration, appraisal and development of our oil and natural gas assets, and coverage of any claims under our insurance policies.
In October 2023, during the Fall 2023 redetermination, the Company’s lending syndicate approved a borrowing base for the facility of $1.25 billion increasing undrawn availability. As of December 31, 2023, borrowings under the Facility totaled $925.0 million and the undrawn availability under the facility was $325.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Corporate Revolver and the undrawn availability was $250.0 million.

Capital Expenditures and Investments
We expect to incur capital costs as we:
•drill additional infill wells and execute exploitation and production activities in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico;
•execute appraisal and development activities in Ghana, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Mauritania and Senegal; and
•execute infrastructure-led exploration and appraisal efforts in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea.
We have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the number of wells we plan to drill, our paying interests in our operations including disproportionate payment amounts, the costs involved in developing or participating in the development of a prospect, the timing of third‑party projects, the availability of suitable equipment and qualified personnel and our cash flows from operations. We also evaluate potential corporate and asset acquisition opportunities to support and expand our asset portfolio, which may impact our budget assumptions. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic, regulatory, health, environmental and competitive uncertainties, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if market conditions deteriorate; or one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect, or if we choose to expand our acquisition, exploration, appraisal, development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may decide to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell assets, equity or debt securities or obtain additional bank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations.
2024 Capital Program
We estimate we will spend approximately $700-$750 million of capital for the year ending December 31, 2024, excluding any acquisitions or divestiture of oil and gas properties during the year. This capital expenditure budget consists of:
•Approximately $250-$300 million related to maintenance activities across our Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, including infill development drilling and integrity spend; 
•Approximately $350-$400 million related to the development of Phase 1 of Greater Tortue Ahmeyim in Mauritania and Senegal and Winterfell in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; 
•Approximately $50-$100 million related to progressing our infrastructure-led exploration and appraisal programs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including Tiberius appraisal activities, and the drilling of the ILX prospect Akeng Deep in Equatorial Guinea, as well as the appraisal plans of our greater gas resources in Mauritania and Senegal, including Phase 2 of Greater Tortue Ahmeyim, Yakaar-Teranga and BirAllah.
The ultimate amount of capital we will spend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and the success of our exploitation and drilling results among other factors. Our future financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by, among other factors, our level of production of oil and the prices we receive from the sale of oil, our ability to effectively hedge future production volumes, the success of our multi-faceted infrastructure-led exploration and appraisal drilling programs, the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, our partners’ alignment with respect to capital plans, and the actual cost of exploitation, exploration, appraisal and development of our oil and natural gas assets, and coverage of any claims under our insurance policies.
Significant Sources of Capital
Facility
The Facility supports our oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development programs and corporate activities. The amount of funds available to be borrowed under the Facility, also known as the borrowing base amount, is determined every March and September. The borrowing base amount is based on the sum of the net present values of net cash flows and relevant capital expenditures reduced by certain percentages as well as value attributable to certain assets’ reserves and/or resources in the Jubilee and TEN Fields in Ghana and the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea. 
In October 2023, during the Fall 2023 redetermination, the Company’s lending syndicate approved a borrowing base of $1.25 billion. As of December 31, 2023, borrowings under the Facility totaled $925.0 million and the undrawn availability under the facility was $325.0 million. 
On November 23, 2022, the Company amended the Facility to update the interest rate benchmark from LIBOR to term SOFR, to be effective as of April 19, 2023. On September 29, 2023, the Company amended the Facility to accede Kosmos Energy Ghana Investments and Kosmos Energy Ghana Holdings Limited to the Facility as obligors. As a result, the additional interests in Jubilee and TEN that were acquired in the October 2021 acquisition of Anadarko WCTP are now included when calculating the borrowing base amount for the Facility, effective as of October 1, 2023. On October 19, 2023, the Company amended the Facility to modify the amortization schedule in order to reduce the number of repayment installments from seven to six equal installments, with the first repayment installment scheduled on October 1, 2024, rather than March 31, 2024. There was no change to the final maturity date or final repayment date.
The Facility provides a revolving credit and letter of credit facility. The availability period for the revolving credit facility expires one month prior to the final maturity date. The letter of credit facility expires on the final maturity date. The available facility amount is subject to borrowing base constraints and, beginning on October 1, 2024, outstanding borrowings will be constrained by an amortization schedule. The Facility has a final maturity date of March 31, 2027. As of December 31, 2023, we had no letters of credit issued under the Facility. We have the right to cancel all the undrawn commitments under the amended and restated Facility. 
If an event of default exists under the Facility, the lenders can accelerate the maturity and exercise other rights and remedies, including the enforcement of security granted pursuant to the Facility over certain assets held by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Facility as of September 30, 2023 (the most recent assessment date). The Facility contains customary cross default provisions.
Corporate Revolver
The Corporate Revolver is available for general corporate purposes and for oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development programs. On November 23, 2022, the Company amended the Corporate Revolver to update the interest rate benchmark from compounded SOFR to term SOFR. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Corporate Revolver and the undrawn availability was $250.0 million.
The available amount is not subject to borrowing base constraints. We have the right to cancel all the undrawn commitments under the Corporate Revolver. We are required to repay certain amounts due under the Corporate Revolver with sales of certain subsidiaries or sales of certain assets. If an event of default exists under the Corporate Revolver, the lenders can accelerate the maturity and exercise other rights and remedies, including the enforcement of security granted pursuant to the Corporate Revolver over certain assets held by us.
We were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Corporate Revolver as of September 30, 2023 (the most recent assessment date). The Corporate Revolver contains customary cross default provisions.
The U.S. and many foreign economies continue to experience uncertainty driven by varying macroeconomic conditions. Although some of these economies have shown signs of improvement, macroeconomic recovery remains uneven. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in extreme volatility in credit, equity, and foreign currency markets, including the European sovereign debt markets and volatility in various other markets. If any of the financial institutions within our Facility or Corporate Revolver are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted. We actively monitor all of the financial institutions participating in our Facility and Corporate Revolver. None of the financial institutions have indicated to us that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on our monitoring activities, we currently believe our banks will be able to perform on their commitments.
Senior Notes
We have three series of senior notes outstanding, which we collectively referred to as the “Senior Notes.” Our 7.125% Senior Notes mature on April 4, 2026, and interest is payable on the 7.125% Senior Notes each April 4 and October 4. Our 7.500% Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2028, and interest is payable on the 7.500% Senior Notes each March 1 and September 1. Our 7.750% Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2027, and interest is payable on the 7.750% Senior Notes each May 1 and November 1.
The Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Kosmos Energy Ltd. and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness (including all borrowings under the Corporate Revolver) and rank effectively junior in right of payment to all of its existing and future secured indebtedness (including all borrowings under the Facility). The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by certain subsidiaries owning the Company's U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, and on a subordinated, unsecured basis by entities that borrow under, or guarantee, our Facility.
GoM Term Loan
In September 2020, the Company entered into a five-year $200 million senior secured term-loan credit agreement secured against the Company's U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets with net proceeds received of $197.7 million after deducting fees and other expenses. On September 15, 2023, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding principal amount of $137.5 million plus accrued interest using cash on hand, constituting payment in full. The GoM Term Loan was subsequently terminated pursuant to, and subject to the terms of, the GoM Term Loan. 
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents maturities by expected debt maturity dates, the weighted-average interest rates expected to be paid on the Facility and Corporate Revolver given current contractual terms and market conditions, and the instrument’s estimated fair value. Weighted‑average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. This table does not take into account amortization of deferred financing costs.

(1)The amounts included in the table represent principal maturities only. The scheduled maturities of debt related to the Facility are based on the level of borrowings and the available borrowing base as of December 31, 2023. Any increases or decreases in the level of borrowings or increases or decreases in the available borrowing base would impact the scheduled maturities of debt during the next five years and thereafter.
(2)Primarily relates to corporate office and foreign office leases.
(3)Represents gross contractual obligations to execute planned future capital projects. Other joint owners in the properties operated by Kosmos will be billed for their working interest share of such costs. Does not include our share of operator’s purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator and excludes commitments for exploration activities, including well commitments and seismic obligations, in our petroleum contracts. The Company's liabilities for asset retirement obligations associated with the dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties are not included. See Note 11—Asset Retirement Obligations of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding these liabilities.
We have a commitment to drill three development wells and one exploration well in Equatorial Guinea. We have a $200.2 million FPSO Contract Liability in Other long-term liabilities related to the deferred sale of the Greater Tortue FPSO. 
In February 2019, Kosmos and BP signed Carry Advance Agreements with the national oil companies of Mauritania and Senegal, which obligate us separately to finance the respective national oil companies’ share of certain development costs. Kosmos’ total share for the two agreements combined originally estimated at approximately $300.0 million, of which $259.2 million has been incurred through December 31, 2023, excluding accrued interest. These amounts are expected to be repaid through the national oil companies’ share of future revenues.
Critical Accounting Policies
This discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date the financial statements are available to be issued. These estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies are detailed in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Accounting Policies.” We have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenues on the volumes of hydrocarbons sold to a purchaser. The volumes sold may be more or less than the volumes to which we are entitled based on our ownership interest in the property. These differences result in a condition known in the industry as a production imbalance. A receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves on such property. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no oil and gas imbalances recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
Our oil and gas revenues are recognized when hydrocarbons have been sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, title has transferred and collection is probable. Certain revenues are based on contracts with provisional pricing and quantity optionality which contain a derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from oil sales at the spot price on the date of sale. The derivative, which is not designated as a hedge, is marked to market through oil and gas revenue each period until the final settlement occurs, which generally is limited to the month after the sale.
Exploration and Development Costs. We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Costs of unproved properties are transferred to proved properties when a determination that proved reserves have been found. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying unproved properties, are expensed as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred. If exploratory wells are determined to be commercially unsuccessful or dry holes, the applicable costs are expensed and recorded in exploration expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized. Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and equipment and to lift oil and natural gas to the surface are expensed as oil and gas production expense.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes as required by the ASC 740—Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal, state and international tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and 
liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of changes in tax laws or tax rates, tax credits, and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize or utilize our deferred tax assets. If realization is not more likely than not, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in no benefit for the deferred tax amounts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. If our estimates and judgments regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets change, the benefits associated with those deferred tax assets may increase or decrease in the period our estimates and judgments change. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of the deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of such allowances, if necessary.
ASC 740 provides a more‑likely‑than‑not standard in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is necessary after weighing all of the available evidence. When evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the following:
•the status of our operations in the particular taxing jurisdiction, including whether we have commenced production from a commercial discovery;
•whether a commercial discovery has resulted in significant proved reserves that have been independently verified;
•the amounts and history of taxable income or losses in a particular jurisdiction;
•projections of future income, including the sensitivity of such projections to changes in production volumes and prices;
•the existence, or lack thereof, of statutory limitations on the period that net operating losses may be carried forward in a jurisdiction; and
•the creation and timing of future income associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets.

Reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion and assessment of impairment of our oil and natural gas properties. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. As additional proved reserves are discovered, reserve quantities and future cash flows will be estimated by independent petroleum consultants and prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the FASB. The accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of:
•the engineering and geological interpretation of available data;
•estimates of the amount and timing of future operating cost, production taxes, development cost and workover cost;
•the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and
•the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations. We account for asset retirement obligations as required by ASC 410 — Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. Under these standards, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a tangible long‑lived asset with an existing asset retirement obligation is acquired, a liability for that obligation is recognized at the asset’s acquisition or in service date. In addition, a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize the asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long‑lived asset by the same amount as the liability. We record increases in the discounted abandonment liability resulting from the passage of time in depletion, depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and the regulations in some countries that we operate often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Additionally, asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.
Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.
Impairment of Long‑lived Assets. We review our long‑lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. ASC 360 — Property, Plant and Equipment requires an impairment loss to be recognized if the carrying amount of a long‑lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long‑lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability, whether in use or under development. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to us are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with ASC 932 — Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties typically by field or by logical grouping of assets with significant shared infrastructure.
For long-lived assets whereby the carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying amount is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in the ASC 820 — Fair Value Measurement. If applicable, we utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving assets and liabilities that are identical or comparable to the item being measured as the basis for determining fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value measurements are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production, pricing estimates, capital and operating costs, market-based weighted average cost of capital, and risk adjustment factors applied to reserves. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then discounted to estimated fair value, using a market-based weighted-average cost of capital. Although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserve quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.
We believe the assumptions used in our analysis to test for impairment are appropriate and result in a reasonable estimate of future cash flows and fair value. Kosmos has consistently used an average of third-party industry forecasts to determine our pricing assumptions. Where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation.
Acquisition Accounting. The purchase price in an acquisition (business combination or asset acquisition) is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the deal announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. The most significant estimates in the allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.
