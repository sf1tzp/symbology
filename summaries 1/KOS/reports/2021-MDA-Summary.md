## Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward‑looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward‑Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10‑K.

**Overview**

Kosmos is a full-cycle deepwater independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused along the Atlantic Margins. Our key assets include production offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as a world-class gas development offshore Mauritania and Senegal. We also maintain a sustainable proven basin exploration program in Equatorial Guinea, Ghana and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that emerged at the beginning of 2020 has resulted in travel restrictions, including border closures, travel bans, social distancing restrictions, various quarantine measures and office closures being ordered in the various countries in which we operate, impacting some of our business operations. These ongoing restrictions have had an impact on the supply chain, resulting in the delay of various operational projects. Globally, the impact of COVID-19 has impacted demand for oil, which also resulted in significant variations in oil prices. The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flows, capital investments, debt capacity and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on oil prices. 

**Recent Developments**

**Corporate**

In March 2021, the Company issued $450.0 million of 7.500% Senior Notes due 2028 and received net proceeds of approximately $444.4 million after deducting fees. We used the net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Corporate Revolver and the Facility, to pay expenses related to the issuance of the 7.500% Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes. 

In May 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Facility Agreement and certain ancillary documents. As part of the amendment, Kosmos elected to lower the overall Facility size from $1.5 billion to $1.25 billion to reduce reliance on the Facility and commitment costs following the completion of the Company’s senior notes issuance in March 2021. The amendment includes a two-year tenor extension, with the Facility’s final maturity now in March 2027. As amended, the Facility has an available borrowing base of approximately $1.24 billion. 

In October 2021, Kosmos completed the acquisition of Anadarko WCTP Company (“Anadarko WCTP”), a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, which owns a participating interest in the WCTP Block and DT Block offshore Ghana, including an 18.0% participating interest in the Jubilee Unit Area and an 11.1% participating interest in the TEN fields. In consideration for the acquisition, Kosmos paid $455.9 million in cash based on an initial purchase price of $550.6 million reduced by certain purchase price adjustments totaling $94.7 million. Additionally, we incurred $9.5 million of transaction related costs, which were capitalized as part of the purchase price. Following closing of the acquisition, Kosmos’ interest in the Jubilee Unit Area increased from 24.1% to 42.1%, and Kosmos’ interest in the TEN fields increased from 17.0% to 28.1%. 

Under the Deepwater Tano Block Joint Operating Agreement, certain joint venture partners have pre-emption rights that, if fully exercised, could reduce our ultimate interest in the Jubilee Unit Area by 3.8% to 38.3%, and our ultimate interest in the TEN fields by 8.3% to 19.8%. In November 2021, we received notice from certain joint venture partners that they intend to exercise their pre-emption rights in relation to Kosmos’ acquisition of additional interests in Ghana. The exercise of pre-emption rights is subject to finalizing definitive agreements with Kosmos and requires approval from GNPC and the Ghanaian Ministry of Energy. The initial purchase price for the pre-empted portion of transaction is approximately $150 million and is subject to additional purchase price closing adjustments. Kosmos would anticipate using any potential proceeds to accelerate debt repayment. 

Kosmos initially funded the purchase price through the issuance of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022 (“Bridge Notes”) and $75.0 million of borrowings under Kosmos’ Facility. Kosmos then refinanced the Bridge Notes in full with the proceeds from the issuance of $400.0 million of 7.750% Senior Notes due 2027 and cash on hand. Kosmos also received $136.6 million in proceeds from a public issuance of 43.1 million shares of Kosmos’ common stock with proceeds used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the Facility during the fourth quarter of 2021. 

Under the terms of our 2020 farm-out agreement, potential contingent consideration is payable by Shell depending on the results of the first four exploration wells Shell drills in the purchased assets, excluding South Africa. Upon approval of the relevant operating committee of an appraisal plan for submission to the relevant governmental authority for any of those first four exploration wells, Shell will be required to pay Kosmos $50.0 million of consideration for each discovery for which an appraisal plan is approved by the relevant operating committee, capped in the aggregate at a maximum of $100.0 million total. 

**Ghana**

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Ghana production averaged approximately 107,700 Bopd gross (26,100 Bopd net) including activity related to our acquisition of additional interests in Ghana commencing October 13, 2021, the acquisition date. Jubilee production averaged approximately 74,900 Bopd gross (20,200 Bopd net) with consistent water injection and gas offtake and TEN production averaged approximately 32,800 Bopd gross (5,900 Bopd net). The Ghana Jubilee catenary anchor leg mooring (“CALM”) buoy was installed and commissioned in February 2021. 

In April 2021, operations re-commenced on a multi-year development drilling program. One Jubilee producer well started production in July 2021 and one Jubilee injector well came online in September 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, a TEN gas injector well and a second Jubilee producer well were successfully completed and brought online in addition to the 

recompletion of a Jubilee water injection well. The rig has continued drilling operations for the multi-year infill development drilling program in 2022, which is expected to include the drilling and completion of two water-injection wells and one producer well in Jubilee and at TEN plans are to drill three development producer wells, one of which is expected to be completed in 2022, and complete one water-injector well in 2022.

**U.S. Gulf of Mexico**

During the year ended December 31, 2021, U.S. Gulf of Mexico production averaged approximately 19,700 Boepd (net) (~82% oil). The impact of the unplanned downtime from hurricanes to our production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was approximately 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year ended December 31, 2021 compared to our previous production forecasts for 2021. Production returned to around pre-hurricane levels in early fourth quarter of 2021. 

In April 2021, the Kodiak #3 infill well located in Mississippi Canyon Block 727 (29.1% working interest) was brought online with one of two zones intermittently producing. During the third quarter of 2021, the well continued to experience production issues and was shut-in. Late in the first quarter of 2022, the Company plans to commence operations to side-track the original Kodiak #3 well, which is expected to be online in the third quarter of 2022, with insurance proceeds expected to cover the costs incurred to return the Kodiak #3 well to normal operations. 

During the second quarter of 2021, the Tornado-5 infill well located in the Green Canyon Block 281 (35.0% working interest) was successfully drilled and completed. The Tornado-5 well was brought online in July 2021 and is performing at the top end of expectations. 

In January 2021, we announced the Winterfell-1 exploration well encountered approximately 26 meters (85 feet) of net oil pay in two intervals. Winterfell-1 was designed to test a sub-salt Upper Miocene prospect located in
