## Summary of Kosmos Energy’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This report outlines Kosmos Energy’s financial performance and key developments as of December 31, 2024. The company’s operations are focused on deepwater exploration and production across Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania, Senegal, and the Gulf of America.

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Revenue:** Total revenue decreased by $26.3 million compared to 2023, primarily due to lower average realized oil and gas prices and increased natural gas sales volumes in Ghana.
*   **Production Costs:** Production costs increased by $140.4 million in 2024, driven by pre-production operating costs associated with the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Phase 1 project, planned workovers in the Gulf of America, and increased production costs in Equatorial Guinea.
*   **Debt & Financing:** The company utilizes a revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) supported by two new lenders, increasing the total commitment to $1.35 billion. The company also refinanced its corporate revolver, reducing the capacity to $165.0 million.
*   **Asset Retirement Obligations:** The company has significant asset retirement obligations, primarily related to decommissioning activities, which are subject to ongoing estimates and judgments.
*   **Impairment:** The company has a significant impairment charge related to the TEN Fields in Ghana.
*   **Strategic Developments:** The company secured a final award in the arbitration proceedings with BP Gas Marketing regarding future LNG sales from the GTA Phase 1 project.

**Critical Accounting Considerations:**

*   Kosmos relies heavily on estimates and judgments in areas such as reserve quantities, future production costs, pricing assumptions, and asset retirement obligations.
*   Changes in these estimates could materially impact the company’s financial results.

**Overall:**

Kosmos Energy’s financial performance in 2024 was impacted by lower commodity prices and increased operational costs. The company’s financial stability is supported by its revolving credit facility and ongoing strategic developments.
