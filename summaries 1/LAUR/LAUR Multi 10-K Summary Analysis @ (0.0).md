*   **Deeper Dive into Specific Initiatives:**  The analysis could briefly mention specific initiatives that drove growth (e.g., “The launch of new online programs in 2023 contributed to enrollment growth”).
*   **More Critical Assessment:** While the analysis is largely descriptive, adding a slightly more critical assessment of management’s decisions (e.g., “The decision to divest from Chile, while reducing risk, also represented a loss of potential revenue”) would add depth.
