Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
You should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition with the “Selected Financial Data” and the audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (or, Form 10-K). This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the “Item 1A. Risk Factors” section of this Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.”
Introduction
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the ‘‘MD&A’’) is provided to assist readers of the financial statements in understanding the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Laureate Education, Inc. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K are presented in U.S. dollars (USD) rounded to the nearest thousand, with the amounts in MD&A rounded to the nearest tenth of a million. Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: 

•   Overview;

•   Results of Operations;

•   Liquidity and Capital Resources;

•   Contractual Obligations;

•   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements;

•   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and

•   Recently Issued Accounting Standards.
Overview
Our Business
We have built the largest international portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions, primarily focused in Latin America, with 875,100 students enrolled at our 29 institutions in nine countries on more than 150 campuses included in our continuing operations as of December 31, 2019, which we collectively refer to as the Laureate International Universities network. We believe the global higher education market presents an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality higher education around the world. Advanced education opportunities drive higher earnings potential, and we believe the projected growth in the middle-class population worldwide and limited government resources dedicated to higher education create substantial opportunities for high-quality private institutions to meet this growing and unmet demand. Our outcomes-driven strategy is focused on enabling students to prosper and thrive in the dynamic and evolving knowledge economy.
As of December 31, 2019, our international portfolio of 29 institutions comprised 28 institutions we owned or controlled and one additional institution that we managed through a joint venture arrangement. We have six operating segments as described below. We group our institutions by geography in: 1) Brazil; 2) Mexico; 3) Andean; 4) Central America & U.S. Campuses; and 5) Rest of World for reporting purposes. Our sixth segment, Online & Partnerships, includes fully online institutions that operate globally.
Discontinued Operations
In 2017, the Company announced the divestiture of certain subsidiaries in our Rest of World and Central America & U.S. Campuses segments. In August 2018, the Company announced the divestiture of additional subsidiaries located in Europe, Asia and Central America. After completing all of the announced divestitures, the Company’s remaining principal markets would be Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru, along with the Online and Partnerships segment and the institutions in Australia and New Zealand. At the time of the August 2018 announcement, the markets being divested by sale (the Discontinued Operations) included the institutions in Portugal and Spain, which were part of the Andean segment, all remaining institutions in the Central America & U.S. Campuses segment, and all remaining institutions in the Rest of World segment, except for Australia, New Zealand and the managed institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and China. The institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were managed under a contract that expired at the end of August 2019 and was not renewed. Accordingly, these institutions were disposed of other than by sale on August 31, 2019, and, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, have been included in Discontinued Operations for all periods 
70

presented. The divestitures represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Accordingly, in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 205-20, ‘‘Discontinued Operations,’’ the results of the divestitures that are part of the strategic shift are presented as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in our Form 10-K. Since our entire Central America & U.S. Campuses operating segment is included in Discontinued Operations, it no longer meets the criteria for a reportable segment under ASC 280, ‘‘Segment Reporting,’’ and, therefore, it is excluded from the segments information for all periods presented. In addition, the portions of the Andean and Rest of World reportable segments that are included in Discontinued Operations have also been excluded from the segment information for all periods presented. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the MD&A relates to continuing operations.
The Company began closing sale transactions in the first quarter of 2018. To date, we have completed the sales of subsidiaries in Cyprus, Italy, China, Germany, Morocco, Thailand, South Africa, India, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Panama, and Costa Rica, as well as Kendall College, LLC (Kendall) and the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences, LLC (St. Augustine) in the United States, and Centro Universitário do Norte (UniNorte), an institution in the Brazil segment that was included in continuing operations as it was not part of the strategic shift. We have not yet completed the divestitures of our subsidiaries in Honduras and Malaysia, as well as NewSchool of Architecture and Design, LLC (NSAD), a small campus-based institution in the United States, for which we have a signed sale agreement. See also Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale, Note 6, Dispositions and Asset Sales and Note 25, Subsequent Events, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Exploration of Strategic Alternatives
On January 27, 2020, Laureate announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the Company to explore strategic alternatives for each of its businesses to unlock shareholder value. As part of this process, the Company will evaluate all potential options for its remaining businesses, including sales, spin-offs or business combinations. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of this process, including whether it will result in the completion of any transaction, as to the values that may be realized from any potential transaction or as to how long the review process will take. During this process of exploring strategic alternatives, if the Company should determine that the estimated fair value of any of its remaining businesses is less than its carrying value, the Company will be required to record impairment charges that could be material. 
Our Segments
Our campus-based segments generate revenues by providing an education that emphasizes professional-oriented fields of study with undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines. Our educational offerings are increasingly utilizing online and hybrid (a combination of online and in-classroom) courses and programs to deliver their curriculum. Many of our largest campus-based operations are in developing markets which are experiencing a growing demand for higher education based on favorable demographics and increasing secondary completion rates, driving increases in participation rates and resulting in continued growth in the number of higher education students. Traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds) have historically been served by public universities, which have limited capacity and are often underfunded, resulting in an inability to meet the growing student demand and employer requirements. This supply and demand imbalance has created a market opportunity for private sector participants. Most students finance their own education. However, there are some government-sponsored student financing programs which are discussed below. These campus-based segments include Brazil, Mexico, Andean, Central America & U.S. Campuses, and Rest of World. Specifics related to each of these campus-based segments and our Online & Partnerships segment are discussed below:

•   In Brazil, approximately 73% of post-secondary students are enrolled in private higher education institutions. While the federal government defines the national curricular guidelines, institutions are licensed to operate by city. Laureate owns 12 institutions in seven states throughout Brazil, with a particularly strong presence in the competitive São Paulo market. Many students finance their own education while others rely on the government-sponsored programs such as Prouni and FIES.

•   Public universities in Mexico enroll approximately two-thirds of students attending post-secondary education. However, many public institutions are faced with capacity constraints or the quality of the education is considered low. Laureate owns two institutions and is present throughout the country with a footprint of over 40 campuses. Each institution in Mexico has a national license. Students in our Mexican institutions typically finance their own education.

•   The Andean segment includes institutions in Chile and Peru. In Chile, private universities enroll approximately 72% of post-secondary students and there are government-sponsored student financing programs. In Peru, the public sector plays a significant role, but private universities are increasingly providing the capacity to meet growing demand.

•   As of December 31, 2019, the Central America &amp; U.S. Campuses segment includes institutions in Costa Rica, Honduras and the United States. Students in Central America typically finance their own education while students in the United States finance
71

their education in a variety of ways, including U.S. Department of Education (DOE) Title IV programs. The entire Central America & U.S. Campuses segment is included in Discontinued Operations. As discussed in Note 25, Subsequent Events, of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we completed the sale of our operations in Costa Rica on January 10, 2020.


•   The Rest of World segment includes campus-based institutions in Asia Pacific with operations in Australia, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Additionally, the Rest of World segment manages one institution in China through a joint venture arrangement and, until August 31, 2019 when the contract expired, the Rest of World segment also managed eight licensed institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The institutions in Malaysia and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are included in Discontinued Operations.

•   The Online &amp; Partnerships segment includes fully online institutions that offer profession-oriented degree programs in the United States through Walden University (Walden), a U.S.-based accredited institution, and through the University of Liverpool and the University of Roehampton in the United Kingdom. These online institutions primarily serve working adults with undergraduate and graduate degree program offerings. Students in the United States finance their education in a variety of ways, including Title IV programs. We no longer accept new enrollments at the University of Liverpool and the University of Roehampton, which are in a teach-out process.
Corporate is a non-operating business unit whose purpose is to support operations. Its departments are responsible for establishing operational policies and internal control standards; implementing strategic initiatives; and monitoring compliance with policies and controls throughout our operations. Our Corporate segment is an internal source of capital and provides financial, human resource, information technology, insurance, legal and tax compliance services. The Corporate segment also contains the eliminations of intersegment revenues and expenses.
The following information for our reportable segments is presented as of December 31, 2019:

Challenges
Our international operations are subject to complex business, economic, legal, regulatory, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which may be difficult to adequately address. The majority of our operations are outside the United States. As a result, we face risks that are inherent in international operations, including: fluctuations in exchange rates, possible currency devaluations, inflation and hyper-inflation; price controls and foreign currency exchange restrictions; potential economic and political instability in the countries in which we operate; expropriation of assets by local governments; key political elections and changes in government policies; multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws; and compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—We are a multinational business with continuing operations in nine countries around the world, predominantly in Latin America, and are subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which risks may be difficult to adequately address.” There are also risks associated with our decision to divest certain operations and explore other strategic alternatives. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—Our exploration of strategic alternatives and our activities related to previously announced divestitures may disrupt our ongoing businesses, result in increased expenses and present certain risks to the Company.” We plan to grow our continuing operations organically by: 1) adding new programs and course offerings; 2) expanding target student demographics; and 3) increasing capacity at existing and new campus locations. Our success in growing our business will depend on the ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks related to operating in various countries.

Regulatory Environment and Other Matters
Our business is subject to varying laws and regulations based on the requirements of local jurisdictions. These laws and regulations are subject to updates and changes. We cannot predict the form of the rules that ultimately may be adopted in the future or what effects they might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We will continue to develop and implement necessary changes that enable us to comply with such laws and regulations. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—Our institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—Political and regulatory developments in Chile may materially adversely affect us,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States,” and “Item 1—Business—Industry Regulation” for a detailed discussion of our different regulatory environments and Note 20, Legal and Regulatory Matters, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Key Business Metric
Enrollment
Enrollment is our lead revenue indicator and represents our most important non-financial metric. We define “enrollment” as the number of students registered in a course on the last day of the enrollment reporting period. New enrollments provide an indication of future revenue trends. Total enrollment is a function of continuing student enrollments, new student enrollments and enrollments from acquisitions, offset by graduations, attrition and enrollment decreases due to dispositions. Attrition is defined as a student leaving the institution before completion of the program. To minimize attrition, we have implemented programs that involve assisting students in remedial education, mentoring, counseling and student financing.
Each of our institutions has an enrollment cycle that varies by geographic region and academic program. During each academic year, each institution has a “Primary Intake” period in which the majority of the enrollment occurs. Most institutions also have one or more smaller “Secondary Intake” periods. The first calendar quarter generally coincides with the Primary Intakes for our institutions in the Brazil, Andean and Rest of World segments. The third calendar quarter generally coincides with the Primary Intakes for our institutions in the Mexico and Online & Partnerships segments. 
The following chart shows our enrollment cycles at our continuing operations. Shaded areas in the chart represent periods when classes are generally in session and revenues are recognized. Areas that are not shaded represent summer breaks during which revenues are not typically recognized. The large circles indicate the Primary Intake start dates of our institutions, and the small circles represent Secondary Intake start dates.
Principal Components of Income Statement
Revenues
The majority of our revenue is derived from tuition and educational services. The amount of tuition generated in a given period depends on the price per credit hour and the total credit hours or price per program taken by the enrolled student population. The price per credit hour varies by program, by market and by degree level. Additionally, varying levels of discounts and scholarships are offered depending on market-specific dynamics and individual achievements of our students. Revenues are recognized net of scholarships, other discounts, refunds, waivers and the fair value of any guarantees made by Laureate related to student financing programs. In addition to tuition revenues, we generate other revenues from student fees, dormitory/residency fees and other education-related activities. These other revenues are less material to our overall financial results and have a tendency to trend with tuition revenues. The main drivers of changes in revenues between periods are student enrollment and price. We continually monitor market conditions and carefully adjust our tuition rates to meet local demand levels. We proactively seek the best price and content combinations to remain competitive in all the markets in which we operate. 
Direct Costs
Our direct costs include labor and operating costs associated with the delivery of services to our students, including the cost of wages, payroll taxes and benefits, depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, bad debt expenses, and marketing and promotional costs to grow future enrollments. In general, a significant portion of our direct costs tend to be variable in nature and trend with enrollment, and management continues to monitor and improve the efficiency of instructional delivery. Conversely, as campuses expand, direct costs may grow faster than enrollment growth as infrastructure investments are made in anticipation of future enrollment growth.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs associated with corporate departments, including executive management, finance, legal, business development and other departments that do not provide direct operational services.
Factors Affecting Comparability
Acquisitions
Our past experiences provide us with the expertise to further our mission of providing high-quality, accessible and affordable higher education to students by expanding into new markets if opportunities arise, primarily through acquisitions. Acquisitions affect the comparability of our financial statements from period to period. Acquisitions completed during one period impact comparability to a prior period in which we did not own the acquired entity. Therefore, changes related to such entities are considered “incremental impact of acquisitions” for the first 12 months of our ownership. We have made only small acquisitions in 2019, 2018, and 2017 that had essentially no impact on the comparability of the periods presented. 
Dispositions
Any dispositions of our continuing operations affect the comparability of our financial statements from period to period. Dispositions completed during one period impact comparability to a prior period in which we owned the divested entity. Therefore, changes related to such entities are considered “incremental impact of dispositions” for the first 12 months subsequent to the disposition. As discussed above, all of the divestitures that are part of the strategic shift announced in August 2018 are included in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In November 2019, we completed the sale of UniNorte, which is part of continuing operations, and is, therefore, included in the incremental impact of dispositions.
Foreign Exchange
The majority of our institutions are located outside the United States. These institutions enter into transactions in currencies other than USD and keep their local financial records in a functional currency other than the USD. We monitor the impact of foreign currency movements and the correlation between the local currency and the USD. Our revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency. The USD is our reporting currency and our subsidiaries operate in various other functional currencies, including: Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Chilean Peso, Euro, Mexican Peso, New Zealand Dollar, and Peruvian Nuevo Sol. The principal foreign exchange exposure is the risk related to the translation of revenues and expenses incurred in each country from the local currency into USD. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—Our reported revenues and earnings may be negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and currency exchange rates.” In order to provide a 
framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, we present organic constant currency in our segment results, which is calculated using the change from prior-year average foreign exchange rates to current-year average foreign exchange rates, as applied to local-currency operating results for the current year, and then excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other items, as described in the segments results.
Seasonality
Most of the institutions in our network have a summer break during which classes are generally not in session and minimal revenues are recognized. In addition to the timing of summer breaks, holidays such as Easter also have an impact on our academic calendar. Operating expenses, however, do not fully correlate to the enrollment and revenue cycles, as the institutions continue to incur expenses during summer breaks. Given the geographic diversity of our institutions and differences in timing of summer breaks, our second and fourth quarters are stronger revenue quarters as the majority of our institutions are in session for most of these respective quarters. Our first and third fiscal quarters are weaker revenue quarters because the majority of our institutions have summer breaks for some portion of one of these two quarters. Due to this seasonality, revenues and profits in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results in subsequent quarters and may not be correlated to new enrollment in any one quarter. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—We experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.”
Income Tax Expense
Our consolidated income tax provision is derived based on the combined impact of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Also, discrete items can arise in the course of our operations that can further impact the Company’s effective tax rate for the period. Our tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of earnings between our tax-paying entities, our tax-exempt entities and our loss-making entities for which it is not 'more likely than not' that a tax benefit will be realized on the loss. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Continuing Business—We may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.”

In connection with our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018, we wrote off the remaining goodwill balance of $3.1 million associated with our operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which are now included in Discontinued Operations.
Year Ended December 31, 2017
Upon completion of our impairment testing for 2017, we recorded a total impairment loss of $33.5 million related to the discontinued operations described in Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which under ASC 360-10 are required to be recorded at the lower of their carrying values or their estimated ‘‘fair values less costs to sell.’’ Two subsidiaries in our Central America & U.S. Campuses that met the held-for-sale criteria during the fourth quarter of 2017 recorded impairments totaling approximately $17.4 million, and the German institutions within our Rest of World segment recorded impairment of approximately $16.1 million. Because the estimated fair values of these disposal groups were less than their carrying values by more than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, we recorded an impairment on the long-lived assets and wrote the remaining tradenames and Property and equipment, net down to a carrying value of $0.

Summary Comparison of Consolidated Results
Discussion of Significant Items Affecting the Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017
Year Ended December 31, 2019
During the first quarter of 2019, we used approximately $340.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of St. Augustine to repay a portion of our term loan that had a maturity date of April 2024 (the 2024 Term Loan). In addition, the Company elected to repay approximately $35.0 million of the approximately $51.7 million principal balance outstanding for certain notes payable at a real estate subsidiary in Chile. In connection with these debt repayments, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $10.6 million, primarily related to the write off of a pro-rata portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repaid debt balances. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below.
During the second quarter of 2019, we fully repaid the remaining balance outstanding under our 2024 Term Loan, using the proceeds received from the sales of our operations in India, Spain and Portugal. The remaining proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility. In connection with these debt repayments, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $15.6 million related to the write off of a pro-rata portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repaid debt balances, as well as the debt discount associated with the 2024 Term Loan. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below.
On November 1, 2019, we sold UniNorte, a traditional higher education institution in Manaus, Brazil, which resulted in a loss on sale of approximately $0.3 million. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2019, we dissolved several dormant subsidiaries, resulting in the release of accumulated foreign currency translation loss of approximately $37.5 million. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below and is part of the continuing operations as these entities were not part of the strategic shift described in Note 1, Description of Business, and Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Year Ended December 31, 2018
On February 1, 2018, we amended our Senior Secured Credit Facility to reduce the interest rate on our 2024 Term Loan. In connection with this transaction, we also repaid $350.0 million of the principal balance of the 2024 Term Loan. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a $7.5 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the pro-rata write-off of the term loan's remaining deferred financing costs. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below.
Effective September 30, 2018, the University of Liverpool (Liverpool), an institution in our Online & Partnerships segment, began a teach-out process that is expected to be completed in April 2021. As a result, during the third quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $10.0 million related to fixed assets of this entity that are no longer recoverable based on expected future cash flows.
Year Ended December 31, 2017
During the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed refinancing transactions that resulted in repayment of the previous senior credit facility and the redemption of the 9.250% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes due 2019) (other than $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2019 that the Company exchanged on April 21, 2017 for substantially identical but non-redeemable notes issued under a new indenture (the Exchanged Notes)). As a result of the refinancing transactions, during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we recorded approximately $22.8 million in General and administrative expenses related to new third-party costs. We also recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $8.4 million as a result of the refinancing transactions combined with the repayment of notes in the first quarter related to the note exchange transaction, as discussed in Note 10, Debt in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below.
On August 11, 2017, the remaining Senior Notes due 2019 were exchanged for a total of 18.7 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock and the Senior Notes due 2019 were canceled.
77

In November 2017, we completed the sale of property and equipment at Ad Portas, a for-profit real estate subsidiary in our Andean segment, to UDLA Ecuador, a licensed institution in Ecuador, that was formerly consolidated into Laureate. We recognized an operating gain on the sale of this property and equipment of approximately $20.3 million. This gain is included in direct costs in the table below.
In December 2017, we reached a final purchase price settlement agreement with the counterparty that acquired our Swiss hospitality management schools in 2016, and made a payment of approximately $9.3 million. The total settlement amount was approximately $10.3 million, which we recognized as loss on sales of subsidiaries, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, as it represented an adjustment of the sale purchase price. This loss is included in other non-operating (expense) income in the table below.
Upon completion of our impairment testing for 2017, we recorded a total impairment loss of $7.1 million related to impairments of certain Property and equipment, net as well as impairments of Deferred costs and Other intangible assets, which were not associated with the discontinued operations and therefore are included in the results of our continuing operations. These included the impairment of a lease intangible, certain modular buildings, and online course development costs.

Comparison of Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Revenues decreased by $39.9 million to $3,250.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $3,290.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effect of a net change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenues by $135.4 million, mainly due to weakening of the Chilean Peso and the Brazilian Real relative to the USD compared to 2018. In addition, the incremental impact of the disposition of UniNorte decreased revenues by $8.4 million for 2019 compared to 2018. These decreases in revenues were partially offset by higher average total enrollment at a majority of our institutions, which increased revenues by $86.1 million; the effect of changes in tuition rates and enrollments in programs at varying price points (“product mix”), pricing and timing, which increased revenues by $4.6 million; and other Corporate and Eliminations changes, which accounted for an increase in revenues of $13.2 million.
Direct costs and general and administrative expenses combined decreased by $72.5 million to $2,923.8 million for 2019 from $2,996.3 million for 2018. The direct costs decrease was due to the effect of a net change in foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased costs by $118.7 million; the incremental impact of the disposition of UniNorte, which decreased costs by $7.9 million; changes in acquisition-related contingent liabilities for taxes other-than-income tax, net of changes in indemnification assets, which resulted in a year-over-year decrease in costs of $0.9 million; and other Corporate and Eliminations expenses, which accounted for a decrease in costs of $14.4 million in 2019. Partially offsetting these direct cost decreases was the effect of overall higher organic enrollments, which increased costs by $47.1 million compared to 2018, in addition to share-based compensation expense and Excellence-in-Process (EiP) implementation expense, which increased direct costs by $22.3 million.
Operating income increased by $42.2 million to $326.1 million for 2019 from $283.9 million for 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased operating income at our Andean and Rest of World segments combined with a decrease in impairment loss of $9.5 million and lower 2019 operating expenses at Corporate. These increases in operating income were partially offset by a decrease in operating income at our Brazil segment.
Interest expense, net of interest income decreased by $68.3 million to $155.1 million for 2019 from $223.4 million for 2018. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower average debt balances as a result of the debt repayments.
Other non-operating income (expense) decreased by $137.3 million to expense of $(76.6) million for 2019, compared to income of $60.7 million for 2018. This decrease was attributable to: (1) a decrease in gain on derivative instruments of $81.0 million, primarily related to a gain recorded in 2018 upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock; (2) a loss on sale and disposal of subsidiaries in 2019 compared to a gain in 2018 for a change of $38.0 million, which is primarily related to the release of accumulated foreign currency translation in 2019 upon the dissolution of several dormant subsidiaries; (3) an increase in loss on debt extinguishment of $20.8 million, related to increased debt repayments in 2019; and (4) a decrease in other non-operating income of $3.0 million, primarily related to proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance in 2018, partially offset by an increase in the estimated fair value of an equity security held at Corporate in 2019. These decreases in non-operating income were partially offset by less foreign currency exchange loss of $5.5 million.
Income tax expense decreased by $51.1 million to $80.7 million for 2019 from $131.8 million for 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a year-over-year reduction in withholding tax expense as a result of the redesignation of certain intercompany loans from permanent to temporary during 2018, which increased withholding tax expense in 2018, in addition to a reduction in 2019 withholding tax expense resulting from changes to tax treaties between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased by $31.0 million to $53.9 million for 2019 from $84.9 million for 2018. The income from discontinued operations included impairment charges related to assets held for sale of $43.3 million in 2019 compared to $3.1 million in 2018.
Gain on sales of discontinued operations, net of tax increased by $573.2 million to $869.8 million for 2019 related to the sales of our St. Augustine, Thailand, South Africa, India, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Panama operations, compared to $296.6 million for 2018 related to the sales of Kendall and our institutions in Cyprus, Italy, China, Germany, and Morocco.
Comparison of Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017
Revenues decreased by $42.9 million to $3,290.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3,333.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This revenue decrease was driven by the effect of a net change in foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased revenues by $114.6 million compared to 2017. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher average total enrollment at a majority of our institutions, which increased revenues by $21.2 million; the effect of product mix, pricing and timing, which increased revenues by $41.8 million; and other Corporate and Eliminations changes, which accounted for an increase in revenues of $8.7 million. 
Direct costs and general and administrative expenses combined decreased by $94.5 million to $2,996.3 million for 2018 from $3,090.8 million for 2017. The direct costs decrease was due to the effect of a net change in foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased costs by $89.4 million; share-based compensation expense and EiP implementation expense, which decreased direct costs by $56.5 million; and other Corporate and Eliminations expenses, which accounted for a decrease in costs of $19.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to an expense of $22.8 million in 2017 related to the portion of the refinancing transactions that was deemed to be a debt modification. 
Offsetting these direct cost decreases was the overall higher enrollments and costs related to expanding our continuing operations, which increased costs by $40.8 million compared to 2017. Acquisition-related contingent liabilities for taxes other-than-income tax, net of changes in recorded indemnification assets, increased direct costs by $7.4 million in 2018 and decreased direct costs 
by $2.8 million in 2017, increasing expenses by $10.2 million in 2018 compared to 2017. An operating gain on the sale of an asset group at Ad Portas decreased direct costs by $20.3 million in 2017.
Operating income increased by $48.7 million to $283.9 million for 2018 from $235.2 million for 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased operating income at our Andean and Mexico segments combined with decreased operating loss at our Rest of World segment and lower 2018 operating expenses at Corporate, primarily related to lower share-based compensation expense in 2018 and the 2017 debt modification expenses as described above.
Interest expense, net of interest income decreased by $99.6 million to $223.4 million for 2018 from $323.0 million for 2017. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates during 2018 resulting from the 2017 debt refinancing transactions.
Other non-operating income increased by $49.6 million to $60.7 million for 2018 from $11.1 million for 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a higher gain on derivative instruments of $59.6 million compared to 2017, primarily related to the embedded derivatives on our Series A Preferred Stock that was retired in 2018; other non-operating income in 2018 compared to an expense in 2017 for a change of $14.2 million; an increase in gain on sale of subsidiaries of $10.7 million compared to 2017, primarily related to the adjustment in 2017 of the sale purchase price of Swiss hospitality management schools; and a decrease in loss on debt extinguishment of $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a loss on foreign currency exchange in 2018 compared to gain in 2017, for a change of $35.8 million. 
Income tax benefit (expense) changed by $224.8 million to an expense of $(131.8) million for 2018 from a benefit of $93.0 million for 2017. This change was due in part to a $59.6 million change in recorded withholding tax on intercompany loan redesignations in 2017 and 2018, a $12.9 million 2018 deferred tax asset release on a real estate sale between profitable and not-for-profit entities in Chile, an $8.3 million 2017 valuation allowance release in Brazil, a $4.7 million 2017 contingency release in Brazil, and a $2.8 million 2017 tax benefit related to tax rate change in Chile. In addition, the effects of the U.S. tax reform legislation resulted in a benefit in 2017 of $82.4 million for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities due to the decrease in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, and a $53.3 million benefit for valuation allowance release on the deferred tax assets other than net operating losses that, when realized, will become indefinite-lived net operating losses. Changes in the mix of pre-tax book income attributable to taxable and non-taxable entities in various taxing jurisdictions also contributed to the overall change.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax increased by $7.5 million to $84.9 million for 2018 from $77.4 million for 2017.
Gain on sales of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2018 was $296.6 million related to the sales of our Cyprus, Italy, China, Germany, Morocco, and Kendall subsidiaries in 2018.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations, before equity in net (income) loss of affiliates, net of tax, income tax expense (benefit), (gain) loss on sale or disposal of subsidiaries, net, foreign currency exchange (gain) loss, net, other (income) expense, net, loss (gain) on derivatives, loss on debt extinguishment, interest expense and interest income, plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, loss on impairment of assets and expenses related to implementation of our Excellence-in-Process (EiP) initiative. When we review Adjusted EBITDA on a segment basis, we exclude inter-segment revenues and expenses that eliminate in consolidation. Adjusted EBITDA is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of our board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the payment of incentive compensation to our executive officers and other members of our management team. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.
The following table presents Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles net income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

(a) Represents non-cash, share-based compensation expense pursuant to the provisions of ASC 718, “Stock Compensation.”
(b) Represents non-cash charges related to impairments of long-lived assets. For further details on certain impairment items see “Discussion of Significant Items Affecting the Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.”
(c) EiP implementation expenses are related to our enterprise-wide initiative to optimize and standardize Laureate’s processes, creating vertical integration of procurement, information technology, finance, accounting and human resources. It included the establishment of regional shared services organizations (SSOs) around the world, as well as improvements to the Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting. The EiP initiative also includes other back- and mid-office areas, as well as certain student-facing activities, expenses associated with streamlining the organizational structure and certain non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the planned and completed dispositions. Beginning in 2019, EiP also includes expenses associated with an enterprise-wide program aimed at revenue growth.
Comparison of Depreciation and Amortization, Share-based Compensation and EiP Implementation Expenses for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Depreciation and amortization decreased by $18.6 million to $192.2 million for 2019 from $210.8 million for 2018. The effects of foreign currency exchange decreased depreciation and amortization expense by $7.8 million for 2019 compared to 2018. In addition, the incremental impact of the disposition of UniNorte decreased depreciation and amortization expense by $2.7 million for 2019. Other items decreased depreciation and amortization expense by $8.1 million.
Share-based compensation expense increased by $3.0 million to $12.7 million for 2019 from $9.7 million for 2018. This increase is mostly attributable to the effect of a correction of an immaterial error in the first quarter of 2018, which reduced share-based compensation expense for 2018.
EiP implementation expenses increased by $19.3 million to $115.1 million for 2019 from $95.8 million for 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion in EiP of expenses associated with an enterprise-wide program aimed at revenue growth.
Comparison of Depreciation and Amortization, Share-based Compensation and EiP Implementation Expenses for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
Depreciation and amortization increased by $9.7 million to $210.8 million for 2018 from $201.1 million for 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $15.0 million, primarily attributable to a larger depreciable asset base in 2018 compared to 2017, as well as accelerated depreciation on certain corporate assets whose estimated useful lives were reduced. This increase was partially offset by the effects of foreign currency exchange, which decreased depreciation and amortization expense by $5.3 million for 2018 compared to 2017.
Share-based compensation expense decreased by $52.1 million to $9.7 million for 2018 from $61.8 million for 2017. This decrease is mostly attributable to stock options that were granted to the Company’s then-CEO in 2017 under the Executive Profits Interests (EPI) agreement. The EPI options vested upon consummation of the IPO on February 6, 2017, resulting in additional share-based compensation expense of $14.6 million during 2017. Additionally, in 2017, the Company recognized $21.0 million of share-based compensation expense for award modifications, of which $6.0 million related to stock option repricing and $15.0 million related to the extension of the post-employment exercise periods of vested stock options for several executives in connection with their separation from the Company. Also, in 2018, the Company reversed expense for certain performance-based stock option awards where the performance target became improbable of achievement and recorded the correction of an immaterial error in the prior year.
EiP implementation expenses decreased by $4.4 million to $95.8 million for 2018 from $100.2 million for 2017. The year-over-year decrease in EiP expenses relates primarily to higher severance costs recognized in 2017, which were predominantly contractual termination benefits recognized in accordance with ASC 712, “Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits,” partially offset by higher 2018 expenses attributable to compliance monitoring of information technology general controls and costs incurred in connection with the dispositions.
Segment Results
We have five reportable segments: Brazil, Mexico, Andean, Rest of World, and Online & Partnerships. As discussed in “Overview,” the entire Central America & U.S. Campuses segment is included in Discontinued Operations and therefore is excluded from segment results. For purposes of the following comparison of results discussion, “segment direct costs” represent direct costs by segment as they are included in Adjusted EBITDA, such that depreciation and amortization expense, loss on impairment of assets, share-based compensation expense and EiP implementation expenses have been excluded. Organic enrollment is based on average total enrollment for the period. For a further description of our segments, see “Overview.”
The following tables, derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, presents selected financial information of our reportable segments included in continuing operations:

Revenues decreased by $75.9 million, a 12% decrease from 2018.

•   Product mix, pricing and timing decreased revenues due to an increase in discounts and scholarships as a percentage of revenue, combined with a reduction in the number of students participating in the Brazilian government student loan program (FIES), who have a higher average revenue per student than non-FIES students.

•   Organic enrollment increased during 2019 by 3%, increasing revenues by $24.3 million. The increase in enrollments in 2019 was attributable to growth in distance learning, which has a lower average revenue per student than our campus-based programs.

•   Revenues represented 18% of our consolidated total revenues for 2019 compared to 20% for 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $21.7 million, a 21% decrease from 2018.

•   The sale of UniNorte in 2019 accounted for a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million.

•   Revenues represented 20% of our consolidated total revenues for 2018 compared to 23% for 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $30.2 million, a 23% decrease from 2017.

•   Acquisition-related contingent liabilities for taxes other-than-income tax, net of changes in recorded indemnification assets, increased direct costs by $3.2 million in 2018 and decreased direct costs by $6.2 million in 2017, increasing expenses by $9.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Sources
We anticipate that cash flow from operations and available cash will be sufficient to meet our current operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this report.
Our primary source of cash is revenue from tuition charged to students in connection with our various education program offerings. The majority of our students finance the cost of their own education and/or seek third-party financing programs. We anticipate generating sufficient cash flow from operations in the majority of countries where we operate to satisfy the working capital and financing needs of our organic growth plans for each country. If our educational institutions within one country were unable to maintain sufficient liquidity, we would consider using internal cash resources or reasonable short-term working capital facilities to accommodate any short- to medium-term shortfalls. 
As of December 31, 2019, our secondary source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents of $339.6 million, which does not include $55.4 million of cash recorded at subsidiaries that are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2019. Our cash accounts are maintained with high-quality financial institutions with no significant concentration in any one institution.
The Company also maintains a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions as a source of liquidity. The revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of $410.0 million and a maturity date of October 7, 2024. If certain conditions are satisfied, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Third A&R Credit Agreement) also provides for an incremental revolving and term loan facilities not to exceed $565.0 million plus additional amounts so long as both immediately before and after giving effect to such incremental facilities the Company’s Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as defined in the Third A&R Credit Agreement, on a pro forma basis, does not exceed 2.75x.

Additionally, the buyer assumed obligations to pay approximately $30.0 million in finance lease indebtedness.
Liquidity Restrictions
Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances, which totaled $186.9 million and $195.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Restricted cash consists of cash equivalents held to collateralize standby letters of credit in favor of the DOE. These letters of credit are required by the DOE in order to allow our U.S. institutions to participate in the Title IV program. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $127.3 million and $139 million, respectively, posted as LOCs in favor of the DOE. As of December 31, 2019, the amount required by the DOE to be posted was approximately $125.8 million.
As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had EUR 5.0 million (approximately $5.6 million at December 31, 2019) posted as cash-collateral for LOCs related to the Spain Tax Audits.
As part of our normal operations, our insurers issue surety bonds on our behalf, as required by various state education authorities in the United States. We are obligated to reimburse our insurers for any payments made by the insurers under the surety bonds. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total face amount of these surety bonds was $25.6 million and $22.2 million, respectively. 
Indefinite Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings
We earn a significant portion of our income from subsidiaries located in countries outside the United States. As part of our business strategies, we have determined that, except for one of our institutions in Peru, all earnings from our foreign continuing operations will be deemed indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2019, $275.6 million of our total $339.6 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries, including $157.0 million held by variable interest entities (VIEs). These amounts above do not include $55.4 million of cash recorded at subsidiaries that are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2019, of which $49.5 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, $327.2 million of our total $387.8 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries, including $158.4 million held by VIEs. These amounts above do not include $217.1 million of cash recorded at subsidiaries that are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2018, of which $209.1 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The VIEs' cash and cash equivalents balances are generally required to be used only for the operations of these VIEs.
Our plans to indefinitely reinvest certain earnings are supported by projected working capital and long-term capital requirements in each foreign subsidiary location in which the earnings are generated. We have analyzed our domestic operation's cash repatriation strategies, projected cash flows, projected working capital and liquidity, and the expected availability within the debt or equity markets to provide funds for our domestic needs. As a result, we rely on payments from contractual arrangements, such as intellectual property royalty, network fee and management services agreements, as well as repayments of intercompany loans to meet any of our existing or future debt service and other obligations, a substantial portion of which are denominated in USD. Based on our analysis, we believe we have the ability to indefinitely reinvest these foreign earnings. If our expectations change based on future developments, including as a result of the announcement on January 27, 2020 to explore strategic alternatives, such that some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries may be remitted to the United States in the foreseeable future, we will be required to recognize deferred tax expense and liabilities on those amounts and pay additional taxes. For Peru, we have recognized deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.5 million for the portion of the undistributed foreign earnings that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.

Our short-term liquidity requirements include: funding for debt service (including finance leases); operating lease obligations; payments due to shareholders of acquired companies; payments of deferred compensation; working capital; operating expenses; payments of third-party obligations; capital expenditures; settlements of derivatives; and business development activities.
Long-term liquidity requirements include: payments on long-term debt (including finance leases); operating lease obligations; payments of long-term amounts due to shareholders of acquired companies; payments of deferred compensation; and payments of third-party obligations. 
Debt 
On April 26, 2017, we completed an offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.250% Senior Notes due 2025 (the Senior Notes due 2025).The Senior Notes due 2025 were issued at par and will mature on May 1, 2025. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2025 is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, and the first interest payment date was November 1, 2017.
Substantially concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes due 2025, we consummated a refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility by means of an amendment and restatement of the existing amended and restated credit agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) to provide a new revolving credit facility that had an original borrowing capacity of $385.0 million and originally matured in April 2022 (the Revolving Credit Facility), as well as a syndicated term loan of $1,600.0 million that had a maturity date of April 26, 2024 (the 2024 Term Loan). As previously noted, the 2024 Term Loan was 
fully repaid in 2019. The Company entered into the Third A&R Credit Agreement on October 7, 2019. Among other things, the Third A&R Credit Agreement increased the borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility from $385.0 million to $410.0 million and extended the maturity date from April 26, 2022 to October 7, 2024.

As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Credit Facility was $202.4 million, which consisted entirely of amounts outstanding under our $410.0 million revolving credit facility, as the term loans were fully repaid in 2019 with proceeds from the divestitures. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance under our previous senior credit facility was $1,321.6 million, which consisted of $93.5 million outstanding under our $385.0 million revolving credit facility and an aggregate outstanding balance of $1,228.1 million, net of a debt discount, under the term loans.
Senior Notes

Covenants
Under the Third A&R Credit Agreement, we are subject to a Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA financial maintenance covenant (a leverage ratio covenant), as defined in the Third A&R Credit Agreement, unless certain conditions are satisfied. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant. The maximum ratio, as defined, is 3.50x as of December 31, 2019 and thereafter. In addition, notes payable at some of our locations contain financial maintenance covenants. 
Other Debt
Other debt includes lines of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements of subsidiaries, mortgages payable, and notes payable.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate outstanding balances on our lines of credit were $14.5 million and $37.9 million, respectively.
In December 2017, UVM Mexico entered into an agreement with a bank for a loan of MXN 1,700.0 million (approximately $89.0 million at the time of the loan). The loan matures in December 2023 and carries a variable interest rate based on TIIE, plus an applicable margin, which is established based on the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement (9.06% as of December 31, 2019). Payments on the loan were deferred until December 2018, at which time quarterly principal payments were due, beginning at MXN 42.5 million ($2.2 million at December 31, 2019) and increasing to MXN 76.5 million ($4.0 million at December 31, 2019), with a balloon payment of MXN 425.0 million ($22.4 million at December 31, 2019) due at maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2019, this loan was reassigned to another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding balance of this loan was $77.6 million and $83.1 million, respectively.
The Company obtained financing to fund the construction of two new campuses at one of our institutions in Peru, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas.

We have outstanding notes payable at Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), one of our institutions in Peru. These loans have varying maturity dates through December 2024. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, these loans had an aggregate balance of $23.5 million and $30.2 million, respectively.
In December 2017, one of our subsidiaries in Peru entered into an agreement to borrow PEN 247.5 million (approximately $76.0 million at the agreement date). The loan matures in December 2022. Quarterly payments in the amount of PEN 9.3 million ($2.8 million at December 31, 2019) were due from March 2018 through December 2019. The quarterly payments increase to PEN 14.4 million ($4.4 million at December 31, 2019) in March 2020 through the loan's maturity in December 2022. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, this loan had a balance of $52.3 million and $62.8 million, respectively.
In December 2013, Laureate acquired THINK and financed a portion of the purchase price by borrowing AUD 45.0 million ($31.2 million at December 31, 2019) under a syndicated facility agreement in the form of two term loans of AUD 22.5 million each. Facility A was payable at its maturity date of December 20, 2018. Facility B was amended in 2016 to be a revolving facility of up to AUD 15.0 million ($10.4 million at December 31, 2019) and any balance outstanding was repayable at its maturity date of December 20, 2018. In October 2017, these loan facilities were further amended to provide the lender a security interest in all of the assets of Laureate's Australian operations. In addition, Facility A was converted from a term loan to a loan with a balloon payment due at maturity. In December 2018, these loan facilities were again amended to extend the maturity date from December 20, 2018 to June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $14.4 million and $14.7 million, respectively, was outstanding under these loan facilities.
We acquired Faculdades Metropolitanas Unidas Educacionais Ltda. (FMU) on September 12, 2014 and financed a portion of the purchase price by borrowing amounts under two loans that totaled BRL 259.1 million (approximately $110.3 million at the borrowing date). Beginning in October 2017, the loans require semi-annual principal payments of BRL 22.0 million ($5.4 million at December 31, 2019), continuing through their maturity dates in April 2021. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding balance of these loans was $16.2 million and $28.4 million, respectively.
On December 20, 2017, one of our subsidiaries in Brazil entered into an agreement to borrow BRL 360.0 million (approximately $110.0 million at the time of the loan). The loan matures on December 25, 2022. Quarterly payments in the amount of BRL 13.5 million ($3.3 million at December 31, 2019) were due from March 2019 through December 2019, at which point the quarterly payments increase to BRL 22.5 million ($5.5 million at December 31, 2019) from March 2020 through December 2020, then to BRL 27.0 million ($6.6 million at December 31, 2019) from March 2021 through maturity in December 2022. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the loan had a balance of $75.0 million and $92.7 million, respectively.
In addition to this loan, the same Laureate subsidiary in Brazil entered into two additional loans during the year ended December 31, 2019 totaling BRL 190.0 million (approximately $47.5 million at the time of loan). These loans have maturity dates of May 2021 and December 2021. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on these loans was $46.6 million.
Leases
We conduct a significant portion of our operations from leased facilities. These facilities include our corporate headquarters, other office locations, and many of our higher education facilities. As discussed in Note 11, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have significant liabilities recorded related to our leased facilities, which will require future cash payments.
Due to Shareholders of Acquired Companies
One method of payment for past acquisitions was the use of promissory notes payable to the sellers of the acquired companies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $21.5 million and $45.4 million, respectively, for these liabilities. See also Note 7, Due to Shareholders of Acquired Companies, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
Capital Expenditures 
Capital expenditures consist of purchases of property and equipment and expenditures for deferred costs. Our capital expenditure program is a component of our liquidity and capital management strategy. This program includes discretionary spending, which we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment, to grow our network through the following: (1) capacity expansion at institutions to support enrollment growth; (2) new campuses for institutions in our existing markets; (3) information technology to increase efficiency and controls; and (4) online content development. Our non-discretionary spending includes the maintenance of existing facilities. We typically fund our capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and external financing. In the event that we are unable to obtain the necessary funding for capital expenditures, our long-term growth 
strategy could be significantly affected. We believe that our internal sources of cash and our ability to obtain additional third-party financing, subject to market conditions, will be sufficient to fund our investing activities.
Our total capital expenditures for our continuing and discontinued operations, excluding receipts from the sale of subsidiaries and property and equipment, were $173.3 million, $257.9 million and $293.8 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 33% decrease in capital expenditures for 2019 compared to 2018 was driven mainly by reduced capital expenditures as a result of divestitures, as well as lower spending in Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil due to significant capital expenditures made in prior periods to launch several new campuses in these geographies, and reduced accreditation/regulatory expenditures in Brazil. The 12% decrease in capital expenditures for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower spending on growth initiatives in Brazil and Peru in 2018.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Equity
In connection with certain past acquisitions, we entered into put/call arrangements with certain minority shareholders, and we may be required or elect to purchase additional ownership interests in the associated entities within a specified timeframe. Certain of our call rights contain minimum payment provisions. If we exercise such call rights, the consideration required could be higher than the estimated put values. Upon exercise of these puts or calls, our ownership interests in these subsidiaries would increase. 
Laureate Education, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
Laureate maintains a deferred compensation plan to provide certain executive employees and members of our Board of Directors with the opportunity to defer their salaries, bonuses, and Board of Directors' retainers and fees in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a pre-tax basis. Participants are 100% vested in their respective deferrals and the earnings thereon. Laureate does not make contributions to the plan or guarantee returns on the investments. Although plan investments and participant deferrals are kept in a separate trust account, the assets remain Laureate’s property and are subject to claims of general creditors. 
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, plan assets included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $4.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the plan liabilities reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $6.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of the total plan liability was classified as a current liability; the remainder was noncurrent and recorded in Other long-term liabilities.
Stock Repurchase Program
On August 8, 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $150.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock. In early October 2019, the Company's stock repurchases reached the authorized limit of $150.0 million. On October 14, 2019, the Company's board of directors approved the increase of its existing authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock by $150.0 million for a total authorization (including the previously authorized repurchases) of up to $300.0 million of the Company's Class A common stock. The Company’s repurchases were made in a block trade, as well as on the open market at prevailing market prices and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In January 2020, the Company's stock repurchases reached the total authorized limit of $300.0 million.
Cash Flows
In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of exchange rate changes, acquisitions, and reclassifications, as these effects do not represent operating cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows do not agree with the changes of the operating assets and liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets. The effects of exchange rate changes on cash are presented separately in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years: 

(in millions)                                                            2019                2018                2017
Cash provided by (used in):                                                                                          
Operating activities                                               $339.8              $396.9              $192.2    
Investing activities                                              1,116.8               115.5              (284.7   )
Financing activities                                             (1,674.0   )          (410.1   )           157.6    
Effects of exchange rates changes on cash                            (7.3   )           (13.5   )            25.9    
Change in cash included in current assets held for sale             167.8               (30.9   )           (33.0   )
Net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash        $(57.0   )           $57.8               $58.0    
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $57.1 million to $339.8 million for 2019, compared to $396.9 million for 2018. This decrease in operating cash flows during 2019 was primarily due to the following: (1) changes in operating assets and liabilities and other working capital, which decreased operating cash by $102.9 million, due largely to the year-over-year effect of cash received during the fall intake cycle of 2018 for entities that were subsequently divested in 2019; and (2) proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts were $22.9 million higher in 2018 than in 2019 due to the fact that, in 2018, we received $14.1 million in cash from the settlement of interest rate swaps whereas, in 2019, we made a cash payment of $(8.8) million in order to settle certain cross currency and interest rate swaps, primarily in Chile. 
Partially offsetting these operating cash decreases were increases in operating cash flows resulting from: (1) a $45.4 million decrease in cash paid for interest, prior to interest income, that is attributable to the lower average debt balances as a result of the debt repayments, from $234.1 million of cash paid for interest in 2018 to $188.7 million in 2019; and (2) a decrease in cash paid for taxes of $23.3 million, from $143.0 million in 2018, which included approximately $34.5 million of payments to the Spanish Tax Authorities, to $119.7 million in 2019.
Investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities increased by $1,001.3 million, to $1,116.8 million for 2019 from $115.5 million in 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to: (1) higher cash receipts from the sales of discontinued operations of $890.2 million, from 
$375.8 million in 2018 (for the sales of Kendall and our operations in Cyprus, Italy, China, Germany, and Morocco) to $1,266.0 million in 2019 (for the sales of St. Augustine and our Thailand, South Africa, India, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Panama, and UniNorte operations); (2) a decrease in capital expenditures of $84.6 million; (3) a year-over-year increase in cash from derivative settlements of $22.9 million, related to the foreign exchange swap agreements associated with the sale of the Cyprus and Italy institutions in 2018 and the Spain and Portugal institutions in 2019, as well as the settlement of the net investment hedges in 2019; (4) a year-over-year decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $15.8 million; and (5) proceeds of $11.5 million in the 2019 fiscal period from the sale of shares of a preferred stock investment in a private education company.
Partially offsetting these increases in investing cash flows was the effect of proceeds received from corporate-owned life insurance policies in 2018, resulting in a year-over-year decrease of $26.6 million. Other items accounted for the remaining change of $2.9 million. 
Financing activities
Cash used in financing activities increased by $1,263.9 million to $1,674.0 million for 2019 from $410.1 million for 2018. The increased financing cash outflows were primarily attributable to: (1) higher net payments of long-term debt in 2019 as compared to 2018 of $1,002.2 million, related to the use of divestiture proceeds for debt repayment; (2) payments of $264.1 million made during the third and fourth quarters of 2019 to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program; (3) higher payments for debt issuance costs and redemption and call premiums during 2019 of $8.5 million, which was mostly related to a debt repayment in Chile; (4) higher payments to purchase noncontrolling interests of $5.6 million, primarily attributable to the payment made during 2019 to acquire the remaining 10% noncontrolling interest of one of our operations in India, immediately prior to the sale of those operations; and (5) higher payments of deferred purchase price for acquisitions of $6.5 million, due primarily to the full repayment of the St. Augustine seller note in 2019.
These increases in financing cash outflows were partially offset by: (1) an $11.1 million reduction in dividend payments for the Series A Preferred Stock (no further dividend payments were required following the April 2018 conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Class A common stock); and (2) proceeds from stock option exercises during 2019 of $14.0 million. Other items accounted for the remaining difference of $2.1 million.
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $204.7 million to $396.9 million for 2018, compared to $192.2 million for 2017. This increase in operating cash flows during 2018 was primarily due to the following: (1) cash paid for interest, prior to interest income, decreased by $150.1 million, from $384.2 million for 2017 to $234.1 million for 2018 as a result of the 2017 refinancing transactions and the $350.0 million principal repayment made in connection with the February 1, 2018 amendment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility; (2) during 2017, we fully repaid the FMU seller notes, the interest portion of which was classified in operating cash flows, resulting in a year-over-year increase in operating cash flows of $35.0 million; (3) during 2017, we made payments of $22.8 million for third-party general and administrative expenses in connection with the debt refinancing that was completed during the second quarter of 2017; and (4) proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts increased operating cash flows by $14.1 million for 2018, as compared to 2017, related to cash received from the settlement of interest rate swaps. 
Partially offsetting these operating cash increases was an increase in cash paid for taxes of $12.5 million, from $130.5 million in 2017 to $143.0 million in 2018. The increase in cash paid for taxes was primarily due to approximately $34.8 million of payments made to the Spanish Tax Authorities during 2018, plus a U.S. payment of $3.5 million related to tax reform, partially offset by an approximately $20 million refund received by one of our Spanish subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2018 from an estimated tax payment made in 2016. Changes in operating assets and liabilities and other working capital accounted for the remaining change in operating cash of $4.8 million.
Investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities increased by $400.2 million to an investing cash inflow of $115.5 million for 2018, from an investing cash outflow of $(284.7) million in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the sales of Kendall and the Cyprus, Italy, China, Germany, and Morocco institutions during 2018, which resulted in a $366.0 million year-over-year increase in receipts from the sales of these Discontinued Operations and property and equipment. In addition, capital expenditures decreased from 2017 to 2018 by $35.9 million. Also, in 2018, the Company received proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are deferred compensation plan assets, contributing to a total year-over-year increase in proceeds from insurance of $27.0 million. 
These investing cash increases were partially offset by a $10.0 million realized loss in 2018 on the foreign exchange swap agreements associated with the sale of the Cyprus and Italy institutions, as well as an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $16.2 million, primarily related to the November 2018 acquisition of Avansys in Peru. Other items accounted for the remaining change of $2.5 million. 
Financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities decreased by $567.7 million to a financing cash outflow of $(410.1) million for 2018, compared to a financing cash inflow of $157.6 million for 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to the $456.4 million of net proceeds from the 2017 IPO, and net proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock during 2017 of $55.3 million. Additionally, net payments of long-term debt during 2018, which included the $350.0 million repayment of the 2024 Term Loan, were $242.3 million higher than in 2017. 
These financing cash decreases were partially offset by lower payments during 2018 for debt issuance costs and redemption and call premiums of $80.7 million, related to the debt refinancing that was completed during the second quarter of 2017, in addition to lower payments of deferred price for acquisitions during 2018 versus 2017 of $81.2 million, due primarily to the repayment of the FMU seller note in September 2017. Payments to purchase noncontrolling interests were also $17.3 million lower in 2018 versus 2017. In addition, payments of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock decreased by $8.3 million in 2018, as a result of the April 23, 2018 conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Class A common stock (no further dividend payments are required following the conversion). Other items accounted for the remaining change of $1.2 million.
Contractual Obligations
The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:

                                                                                                                                             Payments due by period

The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2019 of approximately $90.1 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of any cash settlements. It is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the time period.

As of December 31, 2019, we have the following off-balance sheet arrangements:
Student Loan Guarantees
The accredited Chilean institutions in our network participate in a government-sponsored student financing program known as Crédito con Aval del Estado (the CAE Program). As part of the CAE Program, these institutions provide guarantees which result in contingent liabilities to third-party financing institutions, beginning at 90% of the tuition loans made directly to qualified students enrolled through the CAE Program and declining to 60% over time. The guarantees by these institutions are in effect during the period in which the student is enrolled. The maximum potential amount of payments our institutions could be required to make under the CAE Program was approximately $474.0 million and $499.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This maximum potential amount assumes that all students in the CAE Program do not graduate, so that our guarantee would not be assigned to the government, and that all students default on the full amount of the CAE-qualified loan balances. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $30.9 million and $28.3 million, respectively, as estimated long-term guarantee liabilities for these obligations, through a reduction of Revenues. 
Subsidiary Shares as Collateral
In conjunction with the purchase of Universidade Potiguar in Brazil (UNP), we pledged all of the acquired shares as a guarantee of our payments of rents as they become due. In the event that we default on any payment, the pledge agreement provides for a forfeiture of the relevant pledged shares. In the event of forfeiture, Laureate may be required to transfer the books and management of UNP to the former owners.
We acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in Universidade Anhembi Morumbi (UAM Brazil) in April 2013. As part of the agreement to purchase the 49% ownership interest, we pledged 49% of our total shares in UAM Brazil as a guarantee of our payment obligations under the purchase agreement. In the event that we default on any payment, the agreement provides for a forfeiture of the pledged shares.
In connection with the purchase of FMU on September 12, 2014, we pledged our acquired shares to third-party lenders as a guarantee of our payment obligations under the loans that financed a portion of the purchase price. The shares are pledged until full payment of the loans, which mature in April 2021.
In connection with a loan agreement entered into by a Laureate subsidiary in Peru, all of the shares of UPN Peru, one of our universities, were pledged to the third-party lender as a guarantee of the payment obligations under the loan.
Standby Letters of Credit
As of December 31, 2019, Laureate had outstanding letters of credit (LOCs), which consisted primarily of the following:


•   Fully cash-collateralized LOCs of $127.3 million in favor of the DOE, which are included in Restricted cash. These LOCs were required to allow Walden and NewSchool to continue participating in the DOE Title IV program.

•   Fully cash-collateralized LOCs totaling $5.6 million, which are included in Restricted cash, that were issued to continue the appeals process with the Spain Tax Authorities who challenged the holding company structure in Spain.
Surety Bonds
As part of our normal operations, our insurers issue surety bonds on our behalf, as required by various state education authorities in the United States. We are obligated to reimburse our insurers for any payments made by the insurers under the surety bonds. As of December 31, 2019, the total face amount of these fully cash-collateralized surety bonds was $25.6 million. 
In November 2016, in order to continue participating in Prouni, a federal program that offers tax benefits designed to increase higher education participation rates in Brazil, UAM Brazil posted a guarantee in the amount of $15.3 million. In connection with the issuance of the guarantee, UAM Brazil obtained a non-collateralized surety bond from a third party in order to secure the guarantee. The cost of the surety bond was $1.4 million, of which half was reimbursed by the former owner of UAM Brazil, and is being amortized over the five-year term. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As a result, these accounting policies and estimates could materially affect our financial statements and are critical to the understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. Management has discussed the selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
Laureate consolidates in its financial statements certain internationally based educational organizations that do not have shares or other equity ownership interests. Although these educational organizations may be considered not-for-profit entities in their home countries and they are operated in compliance with their respective not-for-profit legal regimes, we believe they do not meet the definition of a not-for-profit entity under GAAP, and therefore we treat them as “for-profit” entities for accounting purposes. These entities generally cannot declare dividends or distribute their net assets to the entities that control them. Under ASC 810-10, “Consolidation,” we have determined that these institutions are VIEs and that Laureate is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because we have, as further described herein: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect their educational and economic performance and (2) the right to receive economic benefits from contractual and other arrangements with the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. We account for the acquisition of the right to control a VIE in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations.”
As with all of our educational institutions, the VIE institutions' primary source of income is tuition fees paid by students, for which the students receive educational services and goods that are proportionate to the prices charged. Laureate maintains control of these VIEs through our rights to designate a majority of the governing entities' board members, through which we have the legal ability to direct the activities of the entities. Laureate maintains a variable interest in these VIEs through mutual contractual arrangements at market rates and terms that provide them with necessary products and services, and/or intellectual property, and has the ability to enter into additional such contractual arrangements at market rates and terms. We also have the ability to transfer our rights to govern these VIEs, or the entities that possess those rights, to other parties, which could yield a return if and when these rights are transferred.
We generally do not have legal entitlement to distribute the net assets of the VIEs. Generally, in the event of liquidation or the sale of the net assets of the VIEs, the net proceeds can only be transferred either to another VIE institution with similar purposes or to the government. In the unlikely case of liquidation or a sale of the net assets of the VIE, we may be able to retain the residual value by naming another Laureate-controlled VIE resident in the same jurisdiction as the recipient, if one exists; however, we generally cannot name a for-profit entity as the recipient. Moreover, because the institution generally would be required to provide for the continued education of its students, liquidation would not be a likely course of action and would be unlikely to result in significant residual assets available for distribution. However, we operate our VIEs as going concern enterprises, maintain control in perpetuity, and have the ability to provide additional contractual arrangements for educational and other services priced at up to market rates with Laureate-controlled service companies. Typically, we are not legally obligated to make additional investments in the VIE institutions.
Laureate for-profit entities provide necessary products and services, and/or intellectual property, to all institutions in the Laureate International Universities network, including the VIE institutions, through contractual arrangements at market rates and terms, which are accretive to Laureate. We periodically modify the rates we charge under these arrangements so that they are priced at or below fair market value and to add additional services. If it is determined that contractual arrangements with any institution are not on market terms, it could have an adverse regulatory impact on such institution. We believe that these arrangements improve the quality of the academic curriculum and the students' educational experience. There are currently four types of contractual arrangements: (i) intellectual property (IP) royalty arrangements; (ii) network fee arrangements; (iii) management service arrangements; and (iv) lease arrangements.

(i)   Under the IP royalty arrangements, institutions in the Laureate International Universities network pay to Laureate royalty payments for the use of Laureate's tradename and best practice policies and procedures.

(ii)   Institutions in the Laureate International Universities network gain access to other network resources, including academic content, support with curriculum design, online programs, professional development, student exchange and access to
dual degree programs, through network fee arrangements whereby the institutions pay stipulated fees to Laureate for such access.

(iii)   Institutions in the Laureate International Universities network contract with Laureate and pay fees under management services agreements for the provision of support and managerial services including access to management, legal, tax, finance, accounting, treasury and other services, which in some cases Laureate provides through shared service arrangements in certain jurisdictions.

(iv)   Laureate for-profit entities own various campus real estate properties and have entered into long-term lease contracts with the respective institutions in the Laureate International Universities network, whereby they pay market-based rents for the use of the properties in the conduct of their educational operations.
Revenues recognized by our for-profit entities from these contractual arrangements with our consolidated VIEs were $39.0 million, $100.2 million and $123.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation.
Under our accounting policy, we allocate all of the income or losses of these VIEs to Laureate unless there is a noncontrolling interest where the economics of the VIE are shared with a third party. The income or losses of these VIEs allocated to Laureate represent the earnings after deducting charges related to contractual arrangements with our for-profit entities as described above. We believe that the income remaining at the VIEs after these charges accretes value to our rights to control these entities.
Laureate's VIEs are generally exempt from income taxes. As a result, the VIEs generally do not record deferred tax assets or liabilities or recognize any income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. No deferred taxes are recognized by the for-profit service companies for the remaining income in these VIEs, as the legal status of these entities generally prevents them from declaring dividends or making distributions to their sponsors. However, these for-profit service companies record income taxes related to revenues from their contractual arrangements with these VIEs.
Risks in relation to the VIEs 
We believe that all of the VIE institutions in the Laureate network are operated in full compliance with local law and that the contractual arrangements with the VIEs are legally enforceable; however, these VIEs are subject to regulation by various agencies based on the requirements of local jurisdictions. These agencies, as well as local legislative bodies, review and update laws and regulations as they deem necessary or appropriate. We cannot predict the form of any laws that may be enacted, or regulations that ultimately may be adopted in the future, or what effects they might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If local laws or regulations were to change, if the VIEs were found to be in violation of existing local laws or regulations, or if the regulators were to question the financial sustainability of the VIEs and/or whether the contractual arrangements were at fair value, local government agencies could, among other actions:

•   revoke the business licenses and/or accreditations of the VIE institutions;

•   void or restrict related-party transactions, such as the contractual arrangements between Laureate and the VIE institutions;

•   impose fines that significantly impact business performance or other requirements with which the VIEs may not be able to comply;

•   require Laureate to change the VIEs' governance structures, such that Laureate would no longer maintain control of the activities of the VIEs; or

•   disallow a transfer of our rights to govern these VIEs, or the entities that possess those rights, to a third party for consideration.
Laureate's ability to conduct our business would be negatively affected if local governments were to carry out any of the aforementioned or other similar actions. In any such case, Laureate may no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs.
The VIEs in Brazil and Mexico include several not-for-profit foundations that had insignificant revenues and operating expenses. Selected Consolidated Statements of Operations information for VIEs that are included in continuing operations was as follows, net of the charges related to the above-described contractual arrangements:

Chile - Higher Education Law
On May 29, 2018, a new Higher Education Law (the New Law) was enacted. Among other things, the New Law prohibits conflicts of interests and related party transactions involving universities and their controlling parties, with certain exceptions. These exceptions include the provision of services that are educational in nature or essential for the university’s purposes.
The New Law established a Superintendency of Higher Education, with authority to regulate institutions of higher education and promulgate regulations and procedures implementing the New Law. As of May 29, 2019, the New Law’s provisions regarding related party transactions came into force and the Superintendent has since issued further interpretive guidance and regulations. Immediately prior to these provisions coming into force, each of the Chilean non-profit universities and the relevant Laureate services provider reached an agreement to terminate the prior network services agreement in favor of an open bidding process, wherein unrelated third parties and Laureate-related providers were invited to compete in the provision of the range of services that are essential to the fulfillment of each of their academic missions. Each of the Chilean non-profit universities has completed all of the bidding and contractual processes subsequent to the May 2019 contract terminations. The Company participated in these open bid processes, conducted by a third party, and was judged to have submitted the superior bid in many of them. Awarded contracts entered into force once the applicable university's board approved them or in January 2020, in the case of some of the educational services, due to the academic calendar. Within the ordinary regulatory course of supervision, the Company and the Chilean non-profit universities will continue to interact with the Superintendent to maintain compliance with the New Law. We do not believe that the New Law will change our relationship with our two technical-vocational institutions in Chile that are for-
profit entities. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate our accounting treatment of the Chilean non-profit universities to determine whether we can continue to consolidate them. Our continuing evaluation of the impact of the New Law may result in changes to our expectations due to changes in our interpretations of the law, assumptions used, and additional guidance that may be issued.
Business Combinations
We apply the purchase accounting standards under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” to acquisitions. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated, for accounting purposes, to individual tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess purchase price over the assigned values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The acquisition date is the date on which control is obtained by the acquiring company. Any non-monetary consideration transferred and any previously held noncontrolling interests that are part of the purchase consideration are remeasured at fair value on the acquisition date, with any resulting gain or loss recognized in earnings. The preliminary allocations of the purchase price are subject to revision in subsequent periods based on the final determination of fair values, which must be finalized no later than the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. See Note 5, Acquisitions, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for details of our business combinations.
Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
We perform annual impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill and tradenames, as of October 1st each year. We also evaluate these assets on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the assets may be impaired. We have not made material changes to the methodology used to assess impairment loss on indefinite-lived tradenames during the past three fiscal years. Our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted in no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived tradenames. If the estimates and related assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames decline, we may be required to record impairment charges for those assets. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.
Goodwill
We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment (i.e., step zero) before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step one of the two-step fair value-based impairment test). A reporting unit is defined as a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management of the segment. If we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is required.
If we do not perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit or determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step fair value-based test is performed. In the first step, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, utilizing a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. If the recorded net assets of the reporting unit are less than the reporting unit’s estimated fair value, then there is no goodwill deemed to be impaired. If the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value, then goodwill is potentially impaired and we perform the second step. In the second step, we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value, the difference is recognized as a loss on impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations.
Our valuation approach utilizes a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis relies on historical data and internal estimates, which are developed as a part of our long-range plan process, and includes an estimate of terminal value based on these expected cash flows using the generally accepted Gordon Dividend Growth formula, which derives a valuation using an assumed perpetual annuity based on the reporting unit’s residual cash flows. The discount rate is based on the generally accepted Weighted Average Cost of Capital methodology, and is derived using a cost of equity based on the generally accepted Capital Asset Pricing Model and a cost of debt based on the typical rate paid by market participants. The market multiples analysis utilizes multiples of business enterprise value to revenues, operating income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of comparable publicly traded companies and multiples based on fair value transactions where public information is available. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit include: (1) the revenue and profitability growth rates and (2) the discount rate.
105

We also evaluate the sensitivity of a change in assumptions related to goodwill impairment, assessing whether a 10% reduction in our estimates of revenue or a 1% increase in our estimated discount rates would result in impairment of goodwill. Using the current estimated cash flows and discount rates, each reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value by at least 15% in instances where we performed step one of the two-step fair value-based impairment testing. We have determined that none of our reporting units with material goodwill were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2019. 
We completed our IPO on February 6, 2017 at an initial public offering price that was below the expected range and since then our stock price at times has traded below the initial public offering price. While our market capitalization is currently in excess of the carrying value of our stockholders’ equity, a significant decline in our stock price for an extended period of time could be considered an impairment indicator that would cause us to perform an interim impairment test that could result in additional impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as indefinite-lived tradenames, generally requires a new determination of the fair value of the intangible asset using the relief-from-royalty method. This method estimates the amount of royalty expense that we would expect to incur if the assets were licensed from a third party. We use publicly available information in determining certain assumptions to assist us in estimating fair value using market participant assumptions. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the intangible asset is adjusted to its new estimated fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived tradenames include: (1) the revenue growth rates; (2) the discount rates; and (3) the estimated royalty rates.
Long-Lived Assets and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of such assets may warrant revision or that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. 
Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to:

•   a significant deterioration of operating results;

•   a change in regulatory environment;

•   a significant change in the use of an asset, its physical condition, or a change in management's intended use of the asset;

•   an adverse change in anticipated cash flows; or

•   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset.
If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined by the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows is the rate commensurate with a similar investment of similar risk. We use judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred and in estimating future cash flows and fair value. Changes in our judgments could result in impairments in future periods.
We recorded impairment losses on long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further details.
Deferred Costs
Deferred costs on the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of direct costs associated with online course development, accreditation and costs to obtain a contract. Deferred costs associated with the development of online educational programs are capitalized after technological feasibility has been established. Deferred online course development costs are amortized to direct costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated period that the associated products are expected to generate revenues. Deferred online course development costs are evaluated on a quarterly basis through review of the corresponding course catalog. If a course is no longer listed or offered in the current course catalog, then the costs associated with its development are written off. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the unamortized balances of online course development costs were $55.7 million and $57.1 million, respectively. We defer direct and incremental third-party costs incurred for obtaining initial accreditation and for the renewal of accreditations. These accreditation costs are amortized to direct costs over the life of the accreditation on a straight-line basis. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the unamortized balances of accreditation costs were $2.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. 
106

Laureate also defers certain commissions and bonuses earned by third party agents and our employees that are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are amortized over the period of benefit, which ranges from two to four years. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the unamortized balances of contract costs were $11.6 million and $7.0 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our total deferred costs were $209.2 million and $184.9 million, respectively, with accumulated amortization of $(139.2) million and $(118.0) million, respectively.
Income Taxes
We record the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. We exercise judgment in assessing future profitability and the likely future tax consequences of these events.
Deferred Taxes
Estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on current tax laws, rates and interpretations, and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. We develop estimates of future profitability based upon historical data and experience, industry projections, forecasts of general economic conditions, and our own expectations. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in our accounting estimates. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, as well as the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment, may impact the amounts of deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of deferred tax assets. 
Tax Contingencies
We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for tax positions, under which we must conclude that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained in order for us to continue to recognize the benefit. This assumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that full knowledge of all relevant information is available. In determining the provision for income taxes, judgment is used, reflecting estimates and assumptions, in applying the more-likely-than-not threshold. A change in the assessment of the outcome of a tax review or audit could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
See Note 16, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for details of our deferred taxes and tax contingencies. 
Indefinite Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings
We earn a significant portion of our income from subsidiaries located in countries outside the United States. Except for one of our institutions in Peru, deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed foreign earnings of continuing operations because management believes that the earnings will be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States under the Company's planned tax-neutral methods. ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” requires that we evaluate our circumstances to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support the assertion that we will reinvest undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely. Our assertion that earnings from our foreign operations will be indefinitely reinvested is supported by projected working capital and long-term capital plans in each foreign subsidiary location in which the earnings are generated. Additionally, we believe that we have the ability to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings based on our domestic operation's cash repatriation strategies, projected cash flows, projected working capital and liquidity, and the expected availability of capital within the debt or equity markets. If our expectations change based on future developments, including as a result of the announcement on January 27, 2020 to explore strategic alternatives, such that some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries may be remitted to the United States in the foreseeable future, we will be required to recognize deferred tax expense and liabilities on those amounts. 
Revenue Recognition
Laureate's revenues primarily consist of tuition and educational service revenues. We also generate other revenues from student fees, dormitory/residency fees and other education-related activities. These other revenues are less material to our overall financial results and have a tendency to trend with tuition revenues. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. These revenues are recognized net of scholarships and other discounts, refunds, waivers and the fair value of any guarantees made by Laureate related to student financing programs. For further description, see also Note 3, Revenue, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Receivables are deemed to be uncollectible when they have been outstanding for two years, or earlier when collection efforts have ceased, at which time they are written off. Prior to that, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce our receivables to their net realizable value. Our allowance estimation methodology is based on the age of the receivables, the status of past-due amounts, historical collection trends, current economic conditions and student enrollment status. In the event that current collection trends differ from historical trends, an adjustment is made to the allowance account and bad debt expense.
Derivatives
In the normal course of business, our operations have significant exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rate changes. Accordingly, we mitigate a portion of these risks through a risk-management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments (derivatives). Laureate selectively enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the earnings impact related to receivables and payables that are denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, in certain cases Laureate uses interest rate swaps to mitigate certain risks associated with floating-rate debt arrangements. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. 
We report all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The values are derived using valuation models commonly used for derivatives. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, forward-price yield curves, notional quantities, measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs. Our fair value models incorporate the measurement of our own nonperformance risk into our calculations. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparty may possibly fail to perform its contractual obligation when we are in a net gain position. As a result, our valuation models reflect measurements for counterparty credit risk. We also actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes that could impact the nonperformance risk calculation for our fair value. We value derivatives using management's best estimate of inputs we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Derivative and hedge accounting requires judgment in the use of estimates that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. External factors, such as economic conditions, will impact the inputs to the valuation model over time. The effect of changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our financial statements. See Note 15, Derivative Instruments, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for details of our derivatives. 
Share-Based Compensation
We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. This option valuation model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected term of the option. Prior to the IPO, the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock was based on third-party valuations. After our IPO, the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock is based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the grant date. Because we have only been publicly traded since February 2017, our volatility estimates are based on an average of: (1) a peer group of companies and (2) Laureate's historical volatility. We estimate the expected term of awards to be the weighted average mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use this method to estimate the expected term because we do not have sufficient historical exercise data.
We have granted restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, and performance awards for which the vesting is based on our annual performance metrics. For interim periods, we use our year-to-date actual results, financial forecasts, and other available information to estimate the probability of the award vesting based on the performance metrics. The related compensation expense recognized is affected by our estimates of the vesting probability of these performance awards. See Note 14, Share-based Compensation and Equity, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further discussion of these arrangements.
