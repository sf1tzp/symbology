## Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”) is provided to assist readers of the financial statements in understanding the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Laureate Education, Inc. This MD&A is presented in the following sections: Overview; Results of Operations; Liquidity and Capital Resources; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.
## Overview
Laureate Education, Inc. is a leading global provider of higher education services. We operate a portfolio of degree-granting institutions in Mexico and Peru. Collectively, we have approximately 336,500 students enrolled at five institutions in these two countries. We believe that the higher education markets in Mexico and Peru present an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between supply and demand for affordable, quality higher education in those markets. We offer a range of programs, including undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines. Our educational offerings are increasingly utilizing online and hybrid (a combination of online and in-classroom) courses and programs to deliver our curriculum.

Summary Comparison of Consolidated Results
Year Ended December 31, 2020
During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.8 million primarily related to the write-off of the accumulated curriculum development costs for a program that the Company decided to stop developing.
During the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $23.8 million related to the Brazil E2G software assets, which were recorded on the Corporate segment, as described in Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
During the third quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a charge of $320.0 million on the Laureate tradename, an intangible asset, as described in Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
In November 2020, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, SC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, signed an agreement to sell the land and buildings of Campus Guadalajara Norte, after a decision was made to relocate all students of Campus Guadalajara Norte to the nearby Campus Zapopan in Jalisco, Mexico. The total purchase price was $13.9 million, prior to transaction fees. The Company recognized a pre-tax operating gain of $5.8 million from this sale, which is included in Direct costs in the table below.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company dissolved a dormant subsidiary, resulting in the release of accumulated foreign currency translation loss of approximately $6.1 million. This loss is included in Other non-operating (expense) income in the table below and is part of Continuing Operations as this entity was not part of the strategic shifts described above in Overview.
Year Ended December 31, 2019
The Company recorded an impairment charge of $147.8 million for 2020, compared to $339.8 million for 2019. This decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to changes in working capital, as well as the year-over-year effect of the divestitures that occurred, as certain of the divesited institutions contributed positive operating cash flows during 2019 prior to divestiture. These factors accounted for a decrease in operating cash flows of approximately $102.9 million, mainly due to the year-over-year effect of cash received during the fall intake cycle of 2018 for entities that were subsequently divested in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by a gain of $45.4 million in cash paid for interest, prior to interest income, that is attributable to the lower average debt balances, from $234.1 million of cash paid for interest in 2018 to $188.7 million in 2019, and a decrease in cash paid for taxes of $23.3 million, from $143.0 million in 2018, which included approximately $34.5 million of payments to the Spanish Tax Authorities, compared to $119.7 million in 2019.
Year Ended December 31, 2018
The Company recorded an impairment charge of $115.5 million for 2019, compared to $410.1 million for 2018. This decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to: (1) higher net payments of long-term debt in 2019 as compared to 2018 of $1,207.2 million, primarily related to the use of divestiture proceeds for debt repayment; (2) payments of $264.1 million made during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, in order to fully repay the St. Augustine seller note; (3) higher payments of $8.5 million in 2019, which was mostly related to a debt repayment in Chile; (4) higher proceeds from the sale of shares of a preferred stock investment in a private education company; and (5) higher payments of deferred purchase price for acquisitions, due primarily to the full repayment of the St. Augustine seller note in 2018.
