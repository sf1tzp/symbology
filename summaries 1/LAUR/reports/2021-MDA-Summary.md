## General Sentiment

Laureate Education, Inc. operates a portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru. We believe that the higher education markets in Mexico and Peru present an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for affordable, quality higher education in those markets. The company’s strategy is to focus on providing high-quality, outcome-focused education to students, which enables them to prosper and thrive in the dynamic and evolving knowledge economy.

## Challenges and Risks

Our operations are outside of the United States and are subject to complex business, economic, legal, regulatory, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which may be difficult to adequately address. These risks include: fluctuations in exchange rates; possible currency devaluations; inflation and hyper-inflation; price controls and foreign currency exchange restrictions; potential economic and political instability in the countries in which we operate; expropriation of assets by local governments; key political elections and changes in government policies; multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws; and compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

We continuously monitor and assess these risks and implement strategies to mitigate them, including hedging currency risk, diversifying our operations, and maintaining strong relationships with local stakeholders.

## Noteworthy Extras

*   **Deferred Costs:** We capitalize direct costs associated with online course development and accreditation, which are then amortized over the estimated period of benefit.
*   **Share-Based Compensation:** We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value stock options, relying on estimates of volatility and expected term.
*   **Derivatives:** We use derivatives to manage currency risk and interest rate risk.
*   **Recently Issued Accounting Standards:** We continuously evaluate and adopt new accounting standards.

##  Key Business Metric

Enrollment is our lead revenue indicator and represents our most important non-financial metric. We define “enrollment” as the number of students registered in a course on the last day of the enrollment reporting period. New enrollments provide an indication of future revenue trends. Total enrollment is a function of continuing student enrollments, new student enrollments and enrollments from acquisitions, offset by graduations, attrition and enrollment decreases due to dispositions. Attrition is defined as a student leaving the institution before completion of the program. To minimize attrition, we have implemented programs that involve assisting students in remedial education, mentoring, counseling and student financing.

##  Segments

We have two reportable segments: Mexico and Peru, as discussed in Overview. For purposes of the following comparison of results discussion, “direct costs” represent direct costs incurred by the segment as they are included in Adjusted EBITDA, such as depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense and our EiP implementation expenses. Organic enrollment is based on average total enrollment for the period. For a further description of our segments, see Overview.

##  Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating business unit whose purpose is to support operations. Its departments are responsible for establishing operational policies and internal control standards, implementing strategic initiatives, and monitoring compliance with policies and controls throughout our operations. Our Corporate segment also contains the eliminations of inter-segment revenues and expenses.
