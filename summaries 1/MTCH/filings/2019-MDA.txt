MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
As used herein, "IAC," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" and similar terms refer to IAC/InterActiveCorp and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
IAC operates Vimeo and Dotdash, among many other online businesses, and also has majority ownership of both Match Group, which includes Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid and Hinge, and ANGI Homeservices, which includes HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List and Handy.
On December 19, 2019, IAC entered into a Transaction Agreement (the "Transaction Agreement") with MTCH, IAC Holdings, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of IAC ("New IAC"), and Valentine Merger Sub LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of IAC. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement, the businesses of MTCH will be separated from the remaining businesses of IAC through a series of transactions that will result in the pre-transaction stockholders of IAC owning shares in two, separate public companies—(1) IAC, which will be renamed Match Group, Inc. ("New Match") and which will own the businesses of MTCH and certain IAC financing subsidiaries, and (2) New IAC, which will be renamed IAC/InterActiveCorp and which will own IAC's other businesses—and the pre-transaction stockholders of 
MTCH (other than IAC) owning shares in New Match. Completion of the Separation, which is expected to occur in mid-second quarter of 2020, is subject to a number of conditions, including approval by a majority of the disinterested shareholders of MTCH, approval of IAC’s shareholders and other customary conditions and approvals. We refer to the full separation as the "Separation".
Sources of Revenue
MTCH's revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time. Revenue is also derived from à la carte features, where users pay a non-recurring fee for a specific action or event, and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences.
ANGI revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and fees from completed jobs sourced through the HomeAdvisor and Handy platforms, and (ii) HomeAdvisor service professional membership subscription fees. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Revenue is also derived from (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals, (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers and (iii) service warranty subscription and other services. Prior to January 1, 2020, Handy recorded revenue on a net basis. Effective January 1, 2020, we modified the Handy terms and conditions so that Handy, rather than the service professional, has the contractual relationship with the consumer to deliver the service and Handy, rather than the consumer, has the contractual relationship with the service professional. Consumers request services and pay for such services directly through the Handy platform and then Handy fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. This change in contractual terms requires gross revenue accounting treatment effective January 1, 2020. Also, in the case of certain tasks, HomeAdvisor provides a pre-priced product offering, pursuant to which consumers can request services through a HomeAdvisor platform and pay for the services directly. HomeAdvisor then fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. Revenue from HomeAdvisor’s pre-priced product offering is also recorded on a gross basis effective January 1, 2020. In addition to changing the presentation of revenue to gross from net, the timing of revenue recognition will change for pre-priced jobs and will be later than the timing of existing consumer connection revenue for HomeAdvisor because we will not be able to record revenue, generally, until the service professional completes the job on our behalf. 
Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly SaaS subscription fees paid by subscribers for self-serve and enterprise subscription plans.
Dotdash revenue consists principally of display advertising revenue and performance marketing revenue. Display advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly by our sales team and through programmatic advertising networks. Performance marketing revenue includes affiliate commerce and performance marketing commissions. Affiliate commerce commissions is generated when Dotdash refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction. Performance marketing commissions are generated on a cost-per-click or cost-per-new account basis.
Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees related to subscription downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as display advertisements. 
Revenue for the businesses within the Emerging & Other segment is generated primarily through advertising, subscriptions and media production and distribution. For periods prior to their sales: Dictionary.com revenue was derived principally from advertising; and Electus revenue was primarily generated through media production and distribution.
Services Agreement with Google
A meaningful portion of the Company's revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement"). In addition, the Company earns certain other advertising revenue from Google that is not attributable to the Services Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, consolidated revenue earned from Google was $733.5 million and $825.2 million, respectively, representing 15% and 19%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenue.
Revenue attributable to the Services Agreement is earned by the Desktop business within the Applications segment and Ask Media Group within the Emerging & Other segment. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, revenue earned 
from the Services Agreement was $291.1 million and $426.5 million, respectively, within the Applications segment and $385.9 million and $339.0 million, respectively, within the Emerging & Other segment.
The current Services Agreement expires on March 31, 2020. On February 11, 2019, the Company and Google amended the Services Agreement, effective as of April 1, 2020. The amendment extends the expiration date of the agreement to March 31, 2023; provided that during September 2020 and during each September thereafter, either party may, after discussion with the other party, terminate the services agreement, effective on September 30 of the year following the year such notice is given. The Company believes that the amended agreement, taken as a whole, is comparable to the Company’s currently existing agreement with Google. The Services Agreement requires that the Company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google. Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. These updates may be specific to the Services Agreement or could be more general and thereby impact the Company as well as other companies. These policy and guideline updates could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, particularly our Desktop business and Ask Media Group. As described below, Google has made changes to the policies under the Services Agreement and has also made industry-wide changes that have negatively impacted the Desktop business during both 2018 and 2019. 
Google’s policy changes related to its Chrome browser, which became effective on September 12, 2018, negatively impacted the distribution of our B2C downloadable desktop products. The resultant reduction in projected profits and revenues of this business resulted in a $27.7 million impairment of the B2C trade name, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. On May 31, 2019, Google announced industry-wide policy changes, which became effective on July 1, 2019, related to all extensions distributed through the Chrome Web Store. These industry-wide changes, combined with other changes to polices under the Services Agreement during the second half of 2019, have had a negative impact on the historical and expected future results of operations of the Desktop business. As of December 31, 2019, the goodwill balance of the Desktop reporting unit and the carrying value of the related intangible asset are $265.1 million and $28.9 million, respectively. The fair values of the Desktop reporting unit and the related intangible asset approximate their carrying values; therefore, a modest reduction in the fair values of the Desktop reporting unit or the related intangible asset would result in an impairment charge, which would be equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of such assets.
Distribution, Marketing and Advertiser Relationships
We pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features and payments made to partners who direct traffic to our Ask Media Group websites, who distribute our business-to-business customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites. We also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as Google and other search engines and social media websites such as Facebook. In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. These distribution channels might also offer their own services and products, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
We market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. For a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, please refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.

•   Revenue increased $494.2 million, or 12%, to $4.8 billion, due to growth from MTCH of $321.4 million and ANGI of $194.0 million, increases of $36.6 million from Dotdash and $36.4 million from Vimeo, partially offset by decreases of $62.8 million from Applications and $31.4 million from Emerging &amp; Other due, in part, to the sales of Electus, Dictionary.com and CityGrid in the fourth quarter of 2018.

•   Operating income increased $16.2 million, or 3%, to $581.3 million, despite the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million, described below, due primarily to a change of $21.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (income of $19.7 million in 2019 compared to expense of $1.5 million in 2018) and a decrease of $15.8 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by increases of $13.0 million in depreciation and $2.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and a $3.3 million goodwill impairment charge related to the College Humor Media business. The income from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments in 2019 is due to the decrease in the expected amount of contingent consideration to be paid in connection with a previous acquisition. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to the inclusion in 2018 of an impairment charge of $27.7 million at Applications related to a trade name at the Desktop business and lower expense from the Combination, partially offset by recent acquisitions and a $6.6 million impairment charge related to a trade name at MTCH. The increase in depreciation was due primarily to the development of capitalized software to support ANGI's products and services, as well as leasehold improvements related to additional office space at ANGI. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards since 2018, including those issued in connection with recent acquisitions, expense of $9.4 million related to the vesting of certain awards for which the market condition was met in the first quarter of 2019 and modification charges at MTCH and Corporate, partially offset by a decrease of $38.0 million in modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination ($32.6 million in 2019 compared to $70.6 million in 2018), a net decrease in a mark-to-market adjustment and the reversal of $7.6 million in cumulative expense in 2019 related to certain performance-based awards that did not vest.

•   Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.1 million to $986.7 million, despite growth of $125.5 million from MTCH and $18.2 million from Dotdash, due primarily to decreases of $45.2 million from ANGI and $28.3 million from Applications, a loss of $7.8 million in 2019 from Emerging &amp; Other compared to a profit of $36.2 million in 2018, and increased losses of $14.6 million and $13.7 million from Corporate and Vimeo, respectively.

•   MTCH revenue increased 19% to $2.1 billion driven by International Direct Revenue growth of $208.3 million, or 27%, and North America Direct Revenue growth of $121.7 million, or 13%. Both International and North America Direct Revenue growth were driven by higher Average Subscribers, up 27% to 4.7 million and 9% to 4.6 million, respectively, due primarily to continued growth in Subscribers at Tinder and Hinge, with Pairs contributing to international growth. Total ARPU increased 2% driven by an increase of 4% in North America ARPU, due to Tinder, as Subscribers purchased more premium subscriptions. International ARPU was unfavorably impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British Pound ("GBP") and certain other currencies.

•   ANGI revenue increased 17% to $1.3 billion driven by Marketplace Revenue growth of $210.7 million, or 27%, the growth of $6.2 million, or 9%, at the European businesses, partially offset by a decrease of $23.0 million, or 8%, in Advertising &amp; Other Revenue. Advertising &amp; Other Revenue decreased due primarily to the sale of Felix on December 31, 2018, partially offset by the contribution from Fixd Repair, acquired on January 25, 2019. Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 17% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 27.4 million and a 3% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 220,000, reflecting, in part, the contribution from Handy. Revenue growth at the European businesses was driven by growth across several countries, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and GBP.

•   Vimeo revenue grew 23% to $196.0 million due to Platform Revenue growth of $47.1 million, or 32%, partially offset by lower Hardware Revenue of $10.7 million due to the sale of the hardware business in the first quarter of 2019. Platform Revenue growth was driven by a 30% increase in Vimeo Ending Subscribers to 1.2 million and a 10% increase in average revenue per subscriber, including the contribution from Magisto, acquired May 28, 2019.

•   Dotdash revenue increased 28% to $167.6 million due to 22% higher Display Advertising Revenue and growth of 51% in Performance Marketing Revenue. Higher Display Advertising Revenue was due primarily to a 26% increase in traffic.

•   Applications revenue decreased 11% to $519.5 million, despite an increase $75.7 million, or 61%, in Mosaic Group, due to a decrease of $138.5 million, or 30%, at Desktop. The decrease at Desktop was driven by lower queries and continuing partnership declines. The increase at Mosaic Group was driven by the acquisitions of TelTech and iTranslate, on October 22, 2018 and March 15, 2018, respectively, growth of 12% related to the ongoing transition to subscription products and new products and the transfer of Daily Burn from the Emerging &amp; Other segment effective April 1, 2018.

•   Emerging &amp; Other revenue decreased 6% to $496.8 million due primarily to the sales of Electus, Dictionary.com and CityGrid in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower revenue at IAC Films, as well as from the transfer of Daily Burn to Mosaic Group, partially offset by higher revenue at Ask Media Group due to growth in paid traffic, primarily in international markets, and the contribution from Bluecrew.

Cost of revenue in 2019 increased from 2018 due to increases of $117.2 million from MTCH and $92.3 million from Emerging & Other.

•   The MTCH increase was due primarily to an increase of $80.1 million in in-app purchase fees paid to Apple and Google as MTCH's revenue continues to be increasingly sourced through mobile app stores, $21.9 million in hosting fees and $11.2 million in compensation expense related to increased customer care personnel.

•   The Emerging &amp; Other increase was due primarily to an increase of $116.9 million in traffic acquisition costs, principally driven by higher revenue at Ask Media Group, and an increase of $16.0 million in payments made to workers staffed by Bluecrew, partially offset by a decrease of $27.0 million in production costs, driven by the sale of Electus in 2018 and lower revenue from IAC Films, the sale of CityGrid in 2018 and the transfer of Daily Burn to Mosaic Group.
Selling and marketing expense

                                                                       Years Ended December 31,

Selling and marketing expense in 2019 increased from 2018 due to increases of $191.8 million from ANGI, $24.4 million from Vimeo and $7.5 million from MTCH, partially offset by decreases of $67.3 million from Emerging & Other and $48.8 million from Applications.

•   The ANGI increase was due primarily to increases in advertising expense of $135.9 million and compensation expense of $24.4 million as well as $29.2 million of expense from the inclusion of Handy and Fixd Repair. The increase in advertising expense was due primarily to increased online marketing and television spend. The efficiency of online marketing spend was negatively impacted by traffic sourced through Google. In 2019, the proportion of service requests through Google free traffic declined while service requests through Google paid traffic increased. In addition, paid service requests were considerably more expensive on average than in 2018. We have implemented new processes in the second half of 2019 and we expect the year over year increase in 2020 to be more modest, particularly in the back half of the year. As our new processes are fully in place, we are increasingly more focused on profitability targets of our paid service requests than the cost of each service request. Compensation expense increased due primarily to growth in the sales force.

•   The Vimeo increase was due primarily to higher marketing of $15.3 million, due primarily to expense from the inclusion of Magisto and a brand campaign in the first half of 2019, and an increase in compensation expense of $9.1 million, due in part, to growth in the sales force.

•   The MTCH increase was due primarily to increases in spending for various marketing campaigns at Tinder, Hinge and Pairs, partially offset by lower marketing spend at Meetic, Match and PlentyOfFish. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expense decreased due primarily to continued revenue growth from brands with relatively lower marketing spend.

•   The Emerging &amp; Other decrease was due primarily to decreases in marketing of $50.2 million at Ask Media Group, driven by a shift in revenue resulting in the payment of traffic acquisition costs, and $5.9 million at IAC Films, the sales of Electus, CityGrid and Dictionary.com, and the transfer of Daily Burn to Mosaic Group, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense of $2.9 million at Bluecrew.

•   The Applications decrease was due primarily to lower online marketing of $63.7 million at Desktop as we mitigated the negative impact on revenue from Google's Chrome Web Store policy changes as well as other changes to policies under the Services Agreement, both of which occurred in 2019, partially offset by higher online marketing of $13.3 million at Mosaic Group due primarily to expense from the inclusion of TelTech and increases at iTranslate and Daily Burn.

                                                                        Years Ended December 31,

As a percentage of revenue                19%                                                18%
General and administrative expense in 2019 increased from 2018 due to increases of $74.7 million from MTCH, $24.8 million from ANGI, $20.9 million from Corporate and $12.4 million from Vimeo, partially offset by a decrease of $11.8 million from Applications and $10.2 million from Emerging & Other.

•   The MTCH increase was due primarily to increases of $38.1 million in legal fees, $19.0 million in compensation expense, including an increase in stock-based compensation expense and headcount, and $4.7 million in non-income taxes, primarily related to the recently enacted French digital services tax, which is retroactive to the beginning of 2019. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year period and the impact from modification charges during 2019.

•   The ANGI increase was due primarily to $30.4 million of expense from the inclusion of Handy and Fixd Repair, including $9.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to awards issued in connection with these acquisitions, an increase of $16.8 million in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue, and increase of $3.0 million in software license and maintenance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $26.5 million in compensation expense and the inclusion in 2018 of $3.6 million in integration-related costs in connection with the Combination. The decrease in compensation expense was due primarily to a decrease of $37.1 million in stock-based compensation expense reflecting a decrease of $33.8 million in expense due to the modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination ($27.2 million in 2019 compared to $61.0 million in 2018) and the reversal of $7.3 million in cumulative expense in 2019 related to certain performance-based awards that did not vest, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since 2018.

•   The Corporate increase was due primarily to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and higher professional fees, including $7.9 million in costs related to the Separation. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year period and from modification charges in 2019, partially offset by a net decrease in a mark-to-market adjustment.

•   The Vimeo increase was due primarily to an increase of $5.3 million in compensation expense due primarily to higher headcount, expense from the inclusion of Magisto and a charge of $2.1 million related to vacating office space.

•   The Applications decrease was due primarily to a change of $20.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (income of $19.7 million in 2019 compared to expense of $1.1 million in 2018), partially offset by an increase of $9.3 million in compensation expense due primarily to recent acquisitions. The income from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments in 2019 is due to the decrease in the expected amount of contingent consideration to be paid in connection with a previous acquisition.

•   The Emerging &amp; Other decrease was due primarily to sales of Electus, Dictionary.com and CityGrid in 2018 and the transfer of Daily Burn to Mosaic Group, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense of $2.7 million from Bluecrew and $1.7 million in transaction costs related to the Care.com acquisition, which closed on February 11, 2020.
General and administrative expense was further impacted by the inclusion in 2018 of a $4.8 million favorable legal settlement.

Product development expense in 2019 increased from 2018 due to increases of $19.9 million from MTCH, $8.1 million from Dotdash and $7.8 million from Vimeo.

•   The MTCH increase was due primarily to an increase of $18.6 million in compensation expense, including an increase of $10.3 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to expense related to the vesting of certain awards for which the market condition was met in 2019, and higher headcount at Tinder.

•   The Dotdash increase was due primarily to an increase of $7.4 million in compensation expense due primarily to higher headcount and an increase in expense for contractors engaged in content development.

•   The Vimeo increase was due primarily to an increase of $6.4 million in compensation expense due primarily to higher headcount and expense from the inclusion of Magisto.

Operating income in 2019 increased from 2018, despite the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million, described below, due primarily to a change of $21.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (income of $19.7 million in 2019 compared to expense of $1.5 million in 2018) and a decrease of $15.8 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by increases of $13.0 million in depreciation and $2.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and a $3.3 million goodwill impairment charge related to the College Humor Media business. The income from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments in 2019 is due to the decrease in the expected amount of contingent consideration to be paid in connection with a previous acquisition. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to the inclusion in 2018 of an impairment charge of $27.7 million at Applications related to a trade name at the Desktop business and lower expense from the Combination, partially offset by recent acquisitions and a $6.6 million impairment charge related to a trade name at MTCH. The increase in depreciation was due primarily to the development of capitalized software to support ANGI's products and services, as well as leasehold improvements related to additional office space at ANGI. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards since 2018, including those issued in connection with recent acquisitions, expense of $9.4 million related to the vesting of certain awards for which the market condition was met in the first quarter of 2019 and modification charges at MTCH and Corporate, partially offset by a decrease of $38.0 million in modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination ($32.6 million in 2019 compared to $70.6 million in 2018), a net decrease in a mark-to-market adjustment and the reversal of $7.6 million in cumulative expense in 2019 related to certain performance-based awards that did not vest.
At December 31, 2019, there was $272.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.3 years.

•   MTCH Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $779.4 million due primarily to the increase of $321.4 million in revenue due to growth at Tinder and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher in-app purchase fees as revenue continues to be increasingly sourced through mobile app stores and higher legal fees.

•   ANGI Adjusted EBITDA decreased 18% to $202.3 million, despite higher revenue, due primarily to higher selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, an increase of $16.8 million in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue, investments in Fixd Repair and Handy, partially offset by the inclusion in 2018 of $9.0 million in costs related to the Combination (including deferred revenue write-offs, severance, retention and integration-related costs).

•   Vimeo Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 49% to a loss of $41.8 million, despite higher revenue, due primarily to higher marketing, including expense from the inclusion of Magisto and a brand campaign in the first half of 2019, as
well as higher compensation expense due primarily to an increase in headcount, including its sales force, and a charge of $2.1 million related to vacating office space.

•   Dotdash Adjusted EBITDA increased 85% to $39.6 million due primarily to higher revenue and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a charge of $2.6 million related to the early termination of a lease.

•   Applications Adjusted EBITDA decreased 21% to $103.6 million due primarily to a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue.

•   Emerging &amp; Other Adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $7.8 million from a profit of $36.2 million in 2018 due primarily to reduced profits at Ask Media Group, reflecting an increase in traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by lower marketing, increased investments in Bluecrew and College Humor Media, and the sales of Dictionary.com and CityGrid, partially offset by the transfer of Daily Burn to Mosaic Group.

•   Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 20% to $88.6 million due primarily to higher professional fees, including $7.9 million in costs related to the Separation.

Other income, net in 2018 includes: a $26.8 million gain on the sale of certain Pinterest shares held by the Company and a $128.8 million unrealized gain (or upward adjustment) to adjust our remaining interest in Pinterest to fair value in accordance with ASU No. 2016-01, which was adopted effective January 1, 2018; $120.6 million in gains related to the sales of Dictionary.com, Electus, Felix and CityGrid; $30.4 million of interest income; and $5.3 million in net foreign currency exchange gains due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the GBP during the year ended December 31, 2019.

For further details of income tax matters, see "Note 3—Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
In 2019, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $49.3 million, despite pre-tax income, due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards and research credits.
In 2018, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.8 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 1%. The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards and a reduction in the estimated Transition Tax. The Transition Tax, part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (the "Tax Act"), was recorded on a provisional basis in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the calculation, which resulted in a $9.2 million reduction in the Transition Tax. The net reduction in the Transition Tax was due primarily to the utilization of additional foreign tax credits and a reduction in state taxes, partially offset by additional taxable earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries based on guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service subsequent to December 31, 2017.
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests
Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders’ percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority, but less than 100%, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements.

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 represents the publicly-held interest in MTCH's and ANGI's earnings as well as third party interests in the subsidiary that held the Company's investment in Pinterest.
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2018 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in MTCH's and ANGI's earnings as well as third party interests in a subsidiary that held the unrealized gains related to our investment in Pinterest, which was adjusted during the second quarter of 2018 to fair value in accordance with ASU No. 2016-01, partially offset by net losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests in certain subsidiaries within the Emerging & Other and Vimeo segments.
PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
IAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
Definition of Non-GAAP Measure
        Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.
The following table reconciles net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to operating income to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:

Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Our Non-GAAP Measure
        Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. Performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). To the extent that stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, the Company remits the required tax-withholding amounts from its current funds.
        Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
        Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as technology, service professional relationships, customer lists and user base, memberships, trade names and content, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

Cash Flow Information
In summary, the Company's cash flows are as follows:
                                                     Years Ended December 31,
2019                                                  2018                   
                                                               (In thousands)
Net cash provided by (used in):                                              
Operating activities                 $937,939                  $988,128      
Investing activities                 (329,529     )            (173,440     )
Financing activities                  399,831                  (312,798     )
Net cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of changes in working capital and acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (to the extent greater than the liability initially recognized at the time of acquisition). Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, net gains on equity securities, net losses (gains) from the sale of businesses, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, bad debt expense and goodwill impairments.
2019
Adjustments to earnings consist primarily of $240.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $92.6 million of amortization of intangibles, $88.4 million of depreciation, and $65.8 million of bad debt expense, partially offset by $80.1 million of deferred income taxes and $37.6 million of net gains on equity securities. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to an increase in tax attribute carryforwards and the realization of gains on certain equity securities. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of increases in accounts receivable of $91.4 million and other assets of $17.7 million, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and other liabilities of $41.9 million and deferred revenue of $37.6 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at ANGI, MTCH and Dotdash. The increase in other assets is due, in part, to an increase in prepaid hosting services at MTCH, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized downloadable search toolbar costs at Applications. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is due, in part, to increases in (i) accrued legal and professional fees at MTCH and IAC, and (ii) accrued interest primarily related to the 5.625% MTCH Senior Notes issued in the first quarter of 2019, the timing of interest payments at MTCH, and the 2026 and 2030 Exchangeable Notes issued in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to growth in subscription sales at Vimeo, Mosaic Group and MTCH.
Net cash used in investing activities includes cash used for investments and acquisitions of $459.4 million, principally related to the investment in Turo and acquisitions of Magisto and Fixd Repair, and capital expenditures of $136.7 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software at ANGI and MTCH to support their products and services, leasehold improvements at ANGI, and the payment of a deposit of $23.0 million for an ownership interest in an aircraft at Corporate, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments and businesses of $165.1 million, principally related to the sale of our investment in Pinterest and the proceeds received in 2019 related to the December 31, 2018 sale of Felix, and proceeds from maturities (net of purchases) of marketable debt securities of $103.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities includes $1.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 and 2030 Exchangeable Notes, $350.0 million in proceeds from the 5.625% MTCH Senior Notes, $40.0 million in borrowings under the MTCH Credit Facility, and $10.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of IAC stock options, partially offset by $300.0 million to repay the outstanding borrowings under the MTCH Credit Facility, $216.4 million for the repurchase of 3.1 million shares of MTCH common stock, on a settlement date basis, at an average price of $70.02 per share, $203.2 million and $35.3 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of MTCH and ANGI employees, respectively, for stock-based awards that were net settled, $136.9 million used to pay the net premium on the exchangeable note hedge and warrant transactions, $93.1 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $56.9 million for the repurchase of 7.2 million shares of ANGI common stock, on a settlement date basis, at an average price of $7.90 per share, $35.0 million for repurchases of IAC debt, $29.2 million for distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests, $27.8 
million of debt issuance costs, and $13.8 million in principal payments on ANGI debt. 
2018
Adjustments to earnings consist primarily of $238.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, $108.4 million of amortization of intangibles, $75.4 million of depreciation, $48.4 million of bad debt expense, partially offset by $152.0 million of net gains on equity securities, $120.0 million of net gains from the sale of businesses, and $34.7 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to amortization of intangibles, a decrease in the valuation allowance, and an increase in credit carryforwards, partially offset by the deferred income tax provision on the net unrealized gains on certain equity securities. The increase from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $53.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $49.5 million, and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $27.0 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $44.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $34.8 million. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is primarily due to increases in (i) accrued employee compensation due, in part, to the timing of payments of cash bonuses, (ii) payables and accruals at Ask Media Group due to growth in paid traffic, primarily in international markets, (iii) accrued advertising at MTCH and (iv) payables at Vimeo due to timing of payments. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to growth in subscription sales at Vimeo, MTCH and Applications. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is due to 2018 income tax accruals in excess of 2018 income tax payments. The increase in other assets is primarily due to increases in (i) capitalized mobile app store fees at MTCH and Applications, (ii) capitalized production costs of various production deals at College Humor Media, Electus, and IAC Films, and (iii) capitalized sales commissions at ANGI. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at ANGI, Ask Media Group, and Dotdash, partially offset by decreases at MTCH and Applications due to an accelerated cash receipt from a mobile app store provider.
Net cash used in investing activities includes cash used for acquisitions and investments of $117.5 million, which includes the TelTech, iTranslate, Bluecrew, and Handy acquisitions, purchases (net of maturities and sales) of marketable debt securities of $116.1 million, capital expenditures of $85.6 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software at ANGI and MTCH to support their products and services and computer hardware, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments of $136.7 million, which includes the sales of Dictionary.com and Electus, and $10.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of Angie's List's campus located in Indianapolis.
Net cash used in financing activities includes $207.7 million and $29.8 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of MTCH and ANGI employees, respectively, for stock-based awards that were net settled, $133.5 million for the repurchase of 3.1 million shares, on a settlement date basis, of MTCH common stock at an average price of $43.72 per share, $105.1 million for dividends paid to MTCH's noncontrolling interest holders, $82.9 million for the repurchase of 0.5 million shares, on a settlement date basis, of IAC common stock at an average price of $152.23 per share, $22.5 million for distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests, $19.0 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees for stock-based awards that were net settled and $13.8 million in principal payments on ANGI debt, partially offset by $260.0 million in borrowings under the MTCH Credit Facility and $41.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of IAC stock options.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash flows generated from operations and available borrowings under the IAC Credit Facility. IAC's consolidated cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2019 were $3.2 billion, of which $465.7 million was held by MTCH and $390.6 million was held by ANGI. The Company generated $937.9 million of operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $658.4 million was generated by MTCH and $214.2 million was generated by ANGI. Each of MTCH and ANGI is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, the Company cannot freely access the cash of MTCH and ANGI and their respective subsidiaries. In addition, certain agreements governing MTCH and ANGI indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions and loans or advances to stockholders, including the Company, in the event a default has occurred or in the case of MTCH, its secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the MTCH Term Loan) exceeds 2.0 to 1.0 or its consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in certain MTCH indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0, and in the case of ANGI, its consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the ANGI Term Loan) exceeds 4.5 to 1.0. There were no such limitations at December 31, 2019.
There were no outstanding borrowings under the IAC, MTCH and ANGI credit facilities at December 31, 2019.
The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and 
expansion of its operations. The Company's 2020 capital expenditures are expected to be lower than 2019 capital expenditures of $136.7 million by approximately 5% to 10%, driven by lower capital expenditures at Corporate due to timing of payments related to the purchase of an aircraft and ANGI related to lower leasehold improvements, partially offset by higher capital expenditures at MTCH due to building improvements related to the expansion of office space at MTCH's Tinder business and the development of capitalized software to support its products and services. The remaining payment of $13.1 million related to the purchase of a 50% interest in the aforementioned aircraft is expected to be made in 2021. 
At December 31, 2019, IAC has 8.0 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
On August 30, 2019, the Board of Directors of MTCH authorized MTCH to repurchase an additional 10 million shares of its common stock; this authorization was in addition to the 1.3 million shares remaining under a previous authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2019, MTCH repurchased 3.1 million shares, on a trade date basis, of its common stock at an average price of $70.02 per share, or $216.4 million in aggregate. MTCH has 9.9 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2019.
On February 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of ANGI authorized ANGI to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2019, ANGI repurchased 7.3 million shares, on a trade date basis, of its common stock at an average price of $7.91 per share, or $57.9 million in aggregate. From January 1, 2020 through February 4, 2020, ANGI repurchased an additional 0.3 million shares at an average price of $8.29 per share, or $2.1 million in aggregate. ANGI had 7.4 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization as of February 4, 2020.
IAC, MTCH and ANGI may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
The Company has granted stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries. These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in IAC shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment which, for purposes of this paragraph is assumed at a 50% withholding rate. The number of IAC common shares that would be required to net settle these vested and unvested interests at current estimated fair values, other than for MTCH, ANGI and their subsidiaries, at January 31, 2020, is 0.1 million shares. In addition, withholding taxes, which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $20.2 million at January 31, 2020. The number of IAC common shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in the Company's stock price and the determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than the Company's estimate. 
The Company currently settles all stock options on a net basis. Assuming all stock options outstanding on January 31, 2020, were net settled on that date, the Company would have issued 1.8 million common shares (of which 1.4 million is related to vested options and 0.4 million is related to unvested options) and would have remitted $430.9 million (of which $341.6 million is related to vested options and $89.3 million is related to unvested options) in cash for withholding taxes (in each case assuming a 50% withholding rate).
The Company's RSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock. These equity awards are settled on a net basis. The number of IAC common shares that would be required to net settle these awards at January 31, 2020 is 0.2 million shares. In addition, withholding taxes, which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the employees upon vest, would have been $38.3 million at January 31, 2020.
MTCH currently settles substantially all equity awards on a net basis. Assuming all MTCH equity awards outstanding on January 31, 2020 were net settled on that date, MTCH would have issued 7.6 million common shares (of which 2.2 million is related to vested shares and 5.4 million is related to unvested shares) and would have remitted $597.0 million (of which $174.7 million is related to vested shares and $422.2 million is related to unvested shares) in cash for withholding taxes (in each case assuming a 50% withholding rate). While certain MTCH stock options ("Tandem Awards") can be settled in MTCH or IAC common stock at the Company's election, the Company is no longer settling the Tandem Awards in IAC stock. 
ANGI currently settles all equity awards on a net basis. In connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into ANGI stock appreciation rights that are settleable, at ANGI's option, on a net basis with ANGI remitting withholding taxes on behalf of the employee or on a gross basis with ANGI issuing a sufficient number of Class A shares to cover the withholding taxes. While these awards can be 
settled in either Class A shares of ANGI or shares of IAC common stock at IAC's option, these awards are currently being settled in shares of ANGI. If settled in IAC common stock, ANGI reimburses IAC in either cash or through the issuance of Class A shares to IAC. Assuming all of the stock appreciation rights outstanding on January 31, 2020 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 6.5 million shares of ANGI Class A stock and ANGI would have remitted $52.3 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate). Assuming all other ANGI equity awards outstanding on January 31, 2020 were net settled on that date, including stock options, RSUs and subsidiary denominated equity, ANGI would have issued 5.1 million shares and would have remitted $41.2 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate).
As of December 31, 2019, IAC's economic interest and voting interest in MTCH is 80.7% and 97.5%, respectively, and in ANGI is 84.1% and 98.1%, respectively. IAC intends to take steps if necessary to maintain an economic interest in each of MTCH and ANGI of at least 80%. In addition, the Transaction Agreement requires MTCH to undertake such steps as necessary to ensure that IAC maintains its 80% economic ownership. 
At December 31, 2019, all of the Company’s international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences.
The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available borrowings under the IAC Credit Facility and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services. The Company’s indebtedness could limit its ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions or capital expenditures, or invest in other areas, such as developing business opportunities. The Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.
On February 11, 2020, IAC completed the acquisition of Care.com under the terms of an agreement dated as of December 20, 2019, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $627 million. Care.com’s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, which would be included as part of the assets acquired, was approximately $96.6 million as of December 31, 2019. 
If the Separation is consummated: 

•   IAC will contribute the cash and cash equivalents held by IAC (except for cash held by ANGI and MTCH) to New IAC. Had the Separation been consummated on December 31, 2019, the approximate amount that would have been contributed as of December 31, 2019 is $1.8 billion. Following this contribution, New IAC’s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance would have been approximately $2.7 billion.

•   MTCH has agreed to make a loan to IAC in an aggregate principal amount equal to the product of (i) $3.00 and (ii) the number of shares of MTCH capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Separation (the ‘‘Match loan’’). As part of the Separation, all MTCH stockholders, other than IAC, in respect of each share of MTCH common stock held, may elect to receive either $3.00 in cash or an additional $3.00 worth of New Match common stock. IAC will contribute the proceeds of the Match loan, less an amount equal to the product of $3.00 multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of MTCH capital stock in respect of which MTCH holders have made a valid cash election, to New IAC. Based on shares outstanding on December 31, 2019, New IAC will receive a contribution of approximately $680 million, assuming all non-IAC MTCH shareholders elect to receive $3.00 in cash and an additional amount of approximately $163 million if all non-IAC MTCH shareholders elect to receive additional MTCH shares. Following the Separation, the Match loan will remain as the obligation of New Match payable to MTCH; New IAC will not have any obligations with regards to the Match loan.

•   New Match will own certain IAC financing subsidiaries that are the issuers of approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of currently outstanding Exchangeable Notes.

•   New IAC’s debt immediately following the consummation of the Separation will relate solely to the ANGI Term Loan, which would have been $245.7 million as of December 31, 2019.
In addition, prior to the closing of the Separation, IAC may enter into agreements with one or more third parties to sell shares of New Match common stock with a value of up to $1.5 billion. The net proceeds of any such offering will be contributed to New IAC following the closing and the number of shares of New Match that IAC stockholders will receive will be reduced to reflect the number of New Match shares sold in this offering.

_______________________________________________________________________________

(a)   The Company has excluded $69.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid. For additional information on income taxes, see "Note 3—Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

(b)   Represents contractual amounts due including interest on both fixed and variable rate instruments. Long-term debt at December 31, 2019 consists of $2.9 billion bearing interest at fixed rates and $0.7 billion bearing interest at variable rates. The variable rate instruments consist of a $425.0 million MTCH Term Loan and a $247.5 million ANGI Term Loan. The MTCH Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%, or 4.44%, at December 31, 2019. The ANGI Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, or 3.25% at December 31, 2019. The amount of interest ultimately paid on the MTCH and ANGI term loans may differ based on changes in interest rates. For additional information on long-term debt arrangements, see "Note 7—Long-term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

(c)   The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with operations under various operating leases, the majority of which contain escalation clauses. Operating lease obligations include legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table above. For additional information on operating leases, see "Note 13—Leases" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

(d)   The purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for cloud computing arrangements, advertising commitments, and a remaining payment related to a 50% interest in a corporate aircraft.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in "Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements
Acquisitions, which are generally referred to in GAAP as business combinations, are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $205.7 million and $243.3 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Handy) in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
Management makes two critical determinations at the time of an acquisition, the reporting unit that will benefit from the acquisition and to which goodwill will be assigned and the allocation of the purchase price of the business to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their fair values. The reporting unit determination is important beyond the initial allocation of purchase price because future impairment assessments of goodwill, as described below, are performed at the reporting unit level. Historically, when the Company’s acquisitions have been complementary to existing reporting units, for example, the 2019 acquisition of Magisto by Vimeo and the 2018 acquisitions of Handy by ANGI and TelTech by Mosaic Group, the goodwill is allocated to these reporting units. Acquisitions within the Emerging & Other reportable segment, such as NurseFly in 2019 and Bluecrew in 2018, usually result in the creation of new reporting units because they are standalone businesses with unique product offerings, management or target markets, for example.
The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values is complex because of the judgments involved in determining these values. The determination of purchase price and the fair value of monetary assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically the least complex aspect of the Company’s accounting for business combinations due to management’s experience and the inherently lower level of complexity. Due to the higher degree of complexity associated with the valuation of intangible assets, the Company usually obtains the assistance of outside valuation experts in the allocation of purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired, which can be both definite-lived, such as acquired technology, customer and contractor relationships, or indefinite lived, such as acquired trade names and trademarks. While outside valuation experts may be used, management has ultimate responsibility for the valuation methods, models and inputs used and the resulting purchase price allocation. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the business combination as of the acquisition date.
In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. The premise underlying the accounting for contingent consideration arrangements is that there are divergent views as to the acquired company’s valuation between the Company and the selling shareholders of the acquiree. Therefore, a model is developed with future payments of a portion of the purchase price linked to one or more financial (e.g., revenue and/or profit performance) and/or operating (e.g., number of subscribers) metrics that will be achieved over a specified time frame in the future based upon the performance of the business. In keeping with the accounting guidance for business combinations, each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and the fair value is included in the aggregate purchase price. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The number of scenarios used is typically greater for longer-term arrangements. The contingent consideration arrangements are reassessed and reflected at current fair values for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "General and administrative expense" in the consolidated statement of operations. Significant changes in the specified forecasted financial or operating metrics can result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, which can result in volatility of general and administrative expense as the resulting remeasurement gains and losses are recorded.
Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. The carrying value of goodwill is $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $446.5 million and $458.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company has the option under GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value; if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment, the Company does not perform a quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit, as of October 1. GAAP provides a not all-inclusive set of examples of macroeconomic, industry, market and company specific factors for entities to consider in performing the qualitative assessment described above; management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments. While the Company also has the option under GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1, in part, because the level of effort required to perform the quantitative and qualitative assessments is essentially equivalent. 
If the conclusion of our qualitative assessment is that there are indicators of impairment and a quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment equal to the excess is recorded.
The Company’s annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time the Company changes its operating segments. Separate from the impact of the change in operating segments, the Company concluded that the Applications operating segment should be split into two reporting units - Desktop and Mosaic Group - effective October 1, 2018. If the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly formed reporting units, the allocation is usually made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values.
For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2019, a qualitative assessment of the MTCH, ANGI, Vimeo, Mosaic Group (included in the Applications segment), College Humor Media, Bluecrew and Nursefly reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:

•   MTCH's October 1, 2019 market capitalization of $20.0 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.8 billion and MTCH's strong operating performance.

•   ANGI's October 1, 2019 market capitalization of $3.6 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $2.2 billion.

•   The Company prepared valuations of the Vimeo, Mosaic Group, Bluecrew and Nursefly reporting units primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity awards that are denominated in the equity of these businesses subsequent to January 1, 2019. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2019. The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2019 carrying value.
For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2019, the Company quantitatively tested the Desktop reporting unit (included in the Applications segment). The Company's quantitative test indicated that there was no impairment. The Company's Dotdash, Ask Media Group and The Daily Beast reporting units have no goodwill.
The aggregate goodwill balance for the Desktop reporting unit for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 10% over its carrying value is approximately $265.1 million.
The fair value of the Company's reporting units (except for MTCH and ANGI described above) is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its non-public subsidiary denominated stock-based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative test. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount 
and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units was 12.5% in 2019 and ranged from 12.5% to 15% in 2018. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. The future cash flows are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10.5% to 27.5% in 2019 and 10.5% to 35% in 2018, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 8% in 2019 and 0.75% to 8% in 2018.
If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. The aggregate carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for which the most recent estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value is less than 10% is approximately $121.2 million.
The 2019 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets identified a $3.3 million goodwill impairment charge and $0.7 million trade name impairment, both related to the College Humor Media business, and a $6.6 million impairment charge related to a trade name at MTCH.
The 2018 annual assessment of goodwill did not identify any impairments. The 2018 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets identified impairment charges of $27.7 million and $1.1 million related to certain Desktop and College Humor Media indefinite-lived trade names, respectively. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Desktop was due to Google’s policy changes related to its Chrome browser which became effective on September 12, 2018 and have negatively impacted the distribution of our B2C downloadable desktop products. The impairment charge related to the B2C trade name was identified in our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2018 and reflects the projected reduction in profits and revenues and the resultant reduction in the assumed royalty rate from these policy changes. The impairment charges are included in "Amortization of intangibles" in the consolidated statement of operations.
Recoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets
We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising right-of-use assets ("ROU assets"), property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is $671.1 million and $492.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of the Company's net deferred tax asset is $145.7 million and $41.2 million, respectively.
The Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $74.4 million and $52.3 million, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
The ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
The Company has not provided for approximately $2.1 million of deferred taxes on $41.8 million of international cash earnings that are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The remaining $171.2 million of international cash can be repatriated without any significant tax consequences. The Company reassesses its intention to remit or permanently reinvest these cash earnings each reporting period; any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the Company changes this intention. During the year ended December 31, 2019, international cash totaling $70.1 million was repatriated to the U.S.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $240.8 million and $238.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is $32.6 million and $70.6 million, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. 
Stock-based compensation at the Company is complex due to our desire to attract, retain, inspire and reward outstanding entrepreneurs and managers at each of our companies, including recently acquired companies, by allowing them to benefit directly from the value they help to create. We accomplish these objectives, in part, by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our non-public subsidiaries as well as in IAC, MTCH and ANGI. We further refine this approach by tailoring certain equity awards to the applicable circumstances. For example, we issue certain equity awards for which vesting is linked to the achievement of a performance target such as revenue or profits; these awards are referred to as performance-based awards. In other cases, we link the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of a value target for a subsidiary or IAC, MTCH or ANGI’s stock price, as applicable; these awards are referred to as market-based awards. The nature and variety of these types of equity-based awards creates complexity in our determination of stock-based compensation expense. 
In addition, acquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. These transactions may result in the modification of equity awards which creates additional complexity and additional stock-based compensation expense. For example, the Combination resulted in the conversion of previously issued HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List awards into ANGI Homeservices awards, and the recognition of additional stock-based compensation expense as described below. In addition, our internal reorganizations can also lead to modifications of equity awards and result in additional complexity and stock-based compensation expense.
Finally, the means by which we settle our equity-based awards also introduces complexity into our financial reporting. We provide a path to liquidity by settling the non-public subsidiary denominated awards in IAC, MTCH or ANGI shares, as applicable. In addition, certain former MTCH and ANGI subsidiary denominated awards can be settled in IAC or MTCH and ANGI awards at the Company’s election. These features increase the complexity of our earnings per share calculations.
The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the Combination) using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the 
weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $3.1 million, $13.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The Company also issues RSUs, performance-based RSUs and market-based RSUs. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For performance-based RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. For market-based RSUs, a lattice model is used to estimate the value of the awards. 
Investments in Equity Securities
The Company invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy. Our equity securities, other than those of our consolidated subsidiaries and those accounted for under the equity method, are accounted for at fair value or under the measurement alternative of ASU No. 2016-01, following its adoption on January 1, 2018, with changes recognized within other income (expense), net each reporting period. Under the measurement alternative, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer; value is generally determined based on a market approach as of the transaction date. A security will be considered identical or similar if it has identical or similar rights to the equity securities held by the Company. The Company reviews its investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values for impairment each reporting period when there are qualitative factors or events that indicate possible impairment. Factors we consider in making this determination include negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company prepares quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments in equity securities, which require judgment and the use of estimates. When our assessment indicates that the fair value of the investment is below its carrying value, the Company writes down the investment to its fair value and records the corresponding charge within other income (expense), net. The carrying value of the Company’s equity securities without readily determinable fair values is $353.1 million and $235.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is included in "Long-term investments" in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company had an investment in Pinterest, which became a publicly-traded company in the second quarter of 2019. With effect from Pinterest's initial public offering, the Company's investment has been accounted for as a marketable security. Prior to this, the Company accounted for its investment in Pinterest as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. During 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $20.5 million on the sale of its remaining shares of Pinterest. During 2018, the Company recognized a gain of $26.8 million on the sale of certain Pinterest shares held by the Company and a $128.8 million unrealized gain (or upward adjustment) to adjust our remaining interest in Pinterest to fair value. In addition, during 2019, the Company recognized $14.5 million in net upward adjustments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. During 2018, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments (or downward adjustments) of $4.9 million related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values and $0.6 million related to an equity method investment.
