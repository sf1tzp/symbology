MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
Match Group, Inc., through its portfolio companies, is a leading provider of digital technologies designed to help people make meaningful connections. Our global portfolio of brands includes Tinder®, Hinge®, Match®, Meetic®, OkCupid®, Pairs™, Plenty Of Fish®, Azar®, BLK®, and more, each built to increase our users’ likelihood of connecting with others. Through our trusted brands, we provide tailored services to meet the varying preferences of our users. Our services are available in over 40 languages to our users all over the world.
We manage our portfolio of brands in four business units: Tinder, Hinge, Evergreen and Emerging, and Match Group Asia.
As used herein, “Match Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to Match Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Sources of Revenue
All of our services provide the use of certain features for free as well as a variety of additional features through a subscription or, for certain features, on a pay-per-use, or à la carte, basis. Our revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees and à la carte purchases.
Subscription revenue is presented net of credits and credit card chargebacks. Payers who purchase subscriptions or à la carte features pay in advance, primarily by using a credit card or through mobile app stores, and, subject to certain conditions identified in our terms and conditions, all purchases are final and nonrefundable. Fees collected, or contractually due, in advance for subscriptions are deferred and recognized as revenue using the straight-line method over the term of the applicable subscription period, which primarily ranges from one week to six months, and corresponding in-app purchase fees incurred on such transactions, if any, are deferred and expensed over the same period. Revenue from the purchase of à la carte features is recognized based on usage. We also earn revenue from online advertising, which is recognized each time an ad is displayed.
Trends affecting our business
Each brand in our portfolio has the goal of using technology to help people make meaningful connections. While the goal is the same for each brand, the means to achieve that goal can be differentiated by how a specific brand targets their primary demographic. With users of our apps often utilizing multiple apps, our brands can often have overlap on targeted users. The overall trends affecting all brands within our portfolio, include the following:
Increase in acceptance and growth of technologies to meet people globally. Over the past decade, there has been meaningful growth in the use of technologies to meet people in North America and Western Europe, and we see the potential for similar growth in the rest of the world in the years ahead. As more internet-connected people seeking connections utilize technologies to meet people, we believe there remains potential for accelerating growth in the use of these technologies in certain global markets where adoption lags more developed countries. As a result, new services, entrants to the market, and business models are likely to continue to emerge, sometimes at the expense of our existing brands, by harnessing a new technology, such as generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) or a new or existing distribution channel, creating a new or different approach to connecting people, or some other means.
In-App Purchase Fees. Purchases made by our customers through mobile applications, as opposed to desktop or mobile web, continue to increase, and are required in most cases to be processed through the in-app payment systems provided by Apple and Google, although some of our applications are currently able to use their own payment systems for in-app purchases made on Android devices. Where we are required to use Apple’s or Google’s payment systems, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a meaningful share (generally 30% or, for subscriptions purchased on Android devices, 15%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions. Where payments on Android devices are processed through other payment systems, we are also required to pay Google a meaningful share. We have entered into a partnership, which started in the second quarter of 2024 and will continue through the first quarter of 2027, with Google that will provide value exchange across our broad relationship with them, which we expect to help offset the additional costs that some of our brands incurred or expect to incur associated with implementing Google’s User Choice Billing system, which allows application developers to offer an additional billing system alongside Google Play’s billing system. 
Additionally, while Apple was recently ordered to change its rules in the U.S. marketplace on anti-steering to allow for payment processing outside its payment systems, Apple has stated that it will still charge up to 27% for those transactions. We do not expect to realize any meaningful decrease in app store fees in the U.S. market as a result of this change. In the European Union, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in March 2024. Apple’s compliance plan lowers the 30% service fee in the EU to 17% for our applications, but also adds a payment processing fee of 3%, as well as a 0.50 Euro fee per download (including updates) per year. Apple’s plan is subject to approval by the European Commission, which has launched infringement proceedings against Apple and may require further concessions from Apple. For additional information, see “Item 1 Business—Dependencies on services provided by others—App Stores.”
Implementing new technologies that enhance our user experience. We expect new technologies, including those utilizing generative AI, will be needed to continue to drive user engagement. As new technologies develop, we evaluate whether those technologies can be incorporated into our apps to enhance the user experience. In particular, we are working to further integrate AI technologies into our services, such as the recent launch of several AI integration initiatives, including the introduction of AI photo selection features to the Tinder and Hinge services, and an enhanced recommendation system, as well as integrated dating support, to the Hinge service. These integrations, and others that may be launched in the future, may become important to our operations over time. The rapid evolution of AI will require the dedication of significant resources to develop, test, and maintain these technologies. We expect other technologies to evolve and be tested in our services and incorporated into our apps in the future.
In addition to the trends affecting our overall portfolio, some of our individual brands are affected by certain other trends, including the following:
Tinder. When Tinder was first developed, the smart phone provided a unique way of offering connections that traditional desktop-based services did not offer. Tinder was able to capitalize on the rise in the use of smart phones and with its younger audience was able to achieve considerable scale through word-of-mouth and viral moments on social media without the need to supplement with significant marketing. As the availability of services catering to human connections has increased, we have begun to supplement Tinder’s viral growth with marketing to build out Tinder’s brand narrative and grow the size of its user base, which has resulted in an increase in selling and marketing expenses at Tinder. In the past two years, Tinder has experienced a decline in user growth, with plans to return to growth through product initiatives that focus on the female experience and younger users.
Hinge. Hinge has developed a strong user base in English speaking markets and began expanding into European markets in the latter half of 2022. Its strong user growth in English speaking and other European markets has helped to contribute to a high level of revenue growth. As Hinge continues to expand its footprint globally, we intend to continue to focus on adding new features to its service to continue to drive user satisfaction for its target audience of intentioned daters, and to drive additional opportunities for monetization. In the near term, we expect to continue to make investments in the business to support Hinge’s growth, including investments in product development as well as marketing.
Evergreen & Emerging. Our collections of brands within E&E include well-known pioneers in online relationships (which we refer to as Evergreen brands) and newer brands which target specific demographics (which we refer to as Emerging brands). Revenues from the Evergreen brands have declined in recent years, while Emerging brands are in the early stages of growth and in many cases are relying on marketing to increase the size of their user base. We are in the middle of our multi-year process of consolidating technology platforms across various Evergreen and Emerging brands to enable faster new feature releases and to reduce the cost to maintain those platforms.
MG Asia. Our Azar app, which provides one to one video chat, has a strong presence in the Middle East, growth in Europe, and expanded into the U.S. in 2024. Azar leverages AI capabilities to drive user growth and monetization globally. Our Pairs brand is a leader in dating in Japan. Pairs began advertising on television in 2024. We expect the advertising to continue to increase Pairs’ brand recognition while we work to grow users through various product initiatives and by partnering with local governments to improve declining marriage rates in the country. Pairs also has plans to expand into other Asian countries in 2025.
Other trends or factors affecting the comparability of our results
Cost of Acquisition. Our cost of acquisition has consistently been one of our larger operating expenses. How we deploy our advertising spend varies among brands, with the majority of our advertising spend taking place online, including social media sites, streaming services, search engines, and influencers. Additionally, some brands utilize offline and out-of-home marketing campaigns, such as on television and outdoor billboards. For established brands, we seek to optimize for total return on advertising spend by frequently analyzing and adjusting spend to focus on marketing channels and markets that generate returns above our thresholds. Our data-driven approach provides us the flexibility to scale and optimize our advertising spend. We spend advertising dollars against an expected lifetime value of a Payer that is realized over a multi-year period. While this advertising spend is intended to be profitable on that basis, it is nearly always negative during the period in which the expense is incurred. For newer brands that are gaining scale, or existing brands that are expanding into new geographies, we may make incremental advertising investments to establish the brand before optimizing monetization of the brand. Our advertising spend may be incurred unevenly throughout the year.
International markets. Our services are available across the world. Our international revenue represented 54% of our total revenue for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. We vary our pricing to align with local market conditions and our international businesses typically earn revenue in local currencies. As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
2024 Consolidated Results
In 2024, total revenue grew 3%, operating income decreased 10%, and Adjusted Operating Income was flat year-over-year. Revenue growth was primarily due to growth at Hinge, and to a lesser extent Tinder, offset by declines at E&E and MG Asia. Operating income and Adjusted Operating Income were positively affected by the increase in revenue. Operating income declined due to increases in non-cash compensation, impairments of certain intangible assets, and depreciation.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 
Tinder Direct Revenue grew $23.0 million, or 1%, in 2024 versus 2023. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Argentine Peso, Turkish Lira, and Japanese Yen, primarily. On a consistent foreign exchange rate basis, the growth was $68.6 million or 4%. Increased Direct Revenue was driven by an increase in RPP of 8% due to subscription pricing optimization, partially offset by decreases in á la carte revenue. The increase in RPP was partially offset by a 7% decrease in Payers.
Hinge Direct Revenue grew $154.0 million, or 39%, in 2024 versus 2023. Revenue growth was driven by both growth in the U.S. market as well as continued expansion efforts in certain European markets. Payers increased 23% compared to 2023. Additionally, RPP increased 13% over 2023 primarily due to pricing optimizations and increased spend on á la carte features.
E&E Direct Revenue declined 7% in 2024 versus 2023. Within E&E, Evergreen brands declined 12%, while Emerging brands grew 17%. The overall decline at E&E was driven by a decline in Payers of 13% compared to 2023, partially offset by increased RPP of 7%. Our decision to terminate certain live streaming services in the second half of 2024 also contributed to the revenue decline compared to 2023.
MG Asia Direct Revenue declined $18.7 million, or 6%, in 2024 versus 2023. Excluding revenue from Hakuna, which was shut down in the third quarter of 2024, MG Asia revenue declined $7.7 million or 3%. Revenue growth was also negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Turkish Lira and Japanese Yen, primarily. On a consistent foreign exchange basis, Direct Revenue grew $7.5 million, or 2%, year-over-year as a result of Payer growth at Azar partially offset by modest Payer declines at Pairs.
Indirect Revenue increased $5.0 million primarily due to higher ad impressions as well as higher rates per ad impression compared to 2023.
For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022
Tinder Direct Revenue grew 7% in 2023 versus 2022, driven by growth in RPP due to pricing optimizations in the U.S. market and new weekly subscription offerings, partially offset by a decrease in Payers partially attributable to the pricing optimizations.
Hinge Direct Revenue grew 40% in 2023 versus 2022, driven by 27% growth in Payers and 10% growth in RPP. The Payer growth at Hinge was across geographies, but in particular in the Americas and Europe, which was a focus of international expansion in 2023 for Hinge. RPP increased as a result of pricing optimizations in the U.S.
E&E Direct Revenue declined 5% in 2023 versus 2022, as we continued to moderate marketing spend at our Evergreen brands. The decline at our Evergreen brands was partially offset by growth at our Emerging brands.
MG Asia Direct Revenue declined 6% in 2023 versus 2022, driven by declines at Hakuna and Pairs, partially offset by growth at Azar.
Indirect Revenue decreased $2.2 million primarily due to a lower rate per ad impression compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher ad impressions.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023
Cost of revenue increased 4% primarily due to an increase in in-app purchase fees of $49.9 million primarily at Hinge as revenue increased and as a result of escrow payments returned in the prior year associated with the Google litigation, which are included in Corporate and Unallocated costs. The increase in in-app purchase fees was partially offset by a decrease in Variable Expenses of $13.9 million primarily at E&E and MG Asia as a result of the termination of certain of our live streaming services and the Hakuna app in 2024. Total in-app purchase fees were $696.6 million in 2024.
For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022
Cost of revenue decreased 1% primarily due to a decrease in Variable Expenses of $20.9 million, primarily related to costs associated with our live streaming services within MG Asia, and a decrease in employee compensation expense of $6.4 million, primarily within Corporate and Unallocated costs and Tinder. The decreases in Variable Expenses and employee compensation expense were partially offset by an increase in in-app purchase fees of $24.2 million, primarily at Tinder and Hinge, partially offset by the benefit from the escrow payments returned in 2023 associated with the Google litigation, which are included in Corporate and Unallocated costs. Total in-app purchase fees were $646.7 million and $622.5 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023
Impairments and amortization of intangibles increased primarily due to impairments of intangible assets of $30.6 million at E&E and MG Asia as a result of the termination of certain of our live streaming services and our Hakuna app in 2024.
For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022
Impairments and amortization of intangibles decreased primarily due to impairments of both indefinite-lived intangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets in the prior period primarily at MG Asia.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023
Operating income decreased 10% or $93.6 million, and Adjusted Operating Income was relatively flat compared to 2023. Operating income and Adjusted Operated Income each benefited from the increase in revenue of $114.9 million, which was driven by growth at Hinge, offset by increased (i) cost of revenue, primarily due to increased in-app purchase fees as revenue at Hinge increased and as a result of returned escrow payments associated with the Google litigation in the prior year, (ii) selling and marketing expense, primarily due to increased cost of acquisition expense, (iii) general and administrative expense, primarily due to increased digital sales taxes, and (iv) product development expense, primarily due to increased employee compensation expense. Operating income was further impacted by increased (i) stock-based compensation expense of $35.3 million, primarily due to increased headcount within product development at Tinder and Hinge, (ii) impairments and amortization of intangible assets of $26.4 million, primarily related to impairments at MG Asia and E&E in 2024, and (iii) depreciation of $25.7 million, primarily related to internally developed software at Tinder, MG Asia, and E&E.
For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022
Operating income increased 78% or $401.9 million, and Adjusted Operating Income increased 11% or $129.8 million. Operating income and Adjusted Operated Income each benefited from the increase in revenue of $175.7 million which was driven by growth at Tinder and Hinge, and lower general and administrative expense primarily related to decreases in legal and other professional fees. That benefit was partially offset by increases in selling and marketing spend and an increase in product development expense primarily due to increased compensation expense. Operating income further benefited from decreases in impairments of intangible assets of $316.1 million, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense primarily due to new stock-based awards granted during the year.
At December 31, 2024, there was $359.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 years.

For discussion of income taxes, see “Note 3—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $152.7 million at an effective tax rate of 22%, which is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible stock-based compensation, partially offset by a lower tax rate on U.S. income derived from foreign sources and research credits.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $125.3 million at an effective tax rate of 16%, which is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to (i) a release of a valuation allowance associated with U.S. foreign tax credits that we now expect to utilize, (ii) a lower tax rate on U.S. income derived from foreign sources, and (iii) the generation of federal and state research credits. These benefits were partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible stock-based compensation.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $15.4 million at an effective tax rate of 4%, which is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to (i) excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, (ii) a release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets that we expect to utilize, (iii) favorable outcomes of tax audits and (iv) a lower tax rate on U.S. income derived from foreign sources. The benefits were partially offset by higher state income taxes due to higher taxable income in the U.S.
A number of countries have enacted or are actively drafting legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's ("OECD") international tax framework, including the Pillar II minimum tax regime. The Company analyzed the impact of enacted legislation and determined it does not have a material impact to the income tax provision. The Company is continuing to monitor future developments.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Match Group reports Adjusted Operating Income and Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects, both of which are supplemental measures to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted Operating Income is among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our business, on which our internal budget is based, and by which management is compensated. Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects provides a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed without the effect of exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods. We believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Match Group endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measures presented by providing the comparable GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measures. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which we discuss below.
Adjusted Operating Income
Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements, as applicable. We believe this measure is useful to analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted Operating Income measure because they are non-cash in nature. Adjusted Operating Income has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of certain expenses.
Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Adjusted Operating Income
Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based RSUs, and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). To the extent stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, we remit the required tax-withholding amounts from current funds.
Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, trade names, and technology, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to (i) acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of trade names and trademarks, and (ii) goodwill, which are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.

Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates on Revenue
The impact of foreign exchange rates on the Company, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in exchange rates is significant. Since our results are reported in U.S. dollars, international revenue is favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. We believe the presentation of revenue excluding the effects from foreign exchange, in addition to reported revenue, helps improve investors’ ability to understand the Company’s performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of Match Group’s core operating results.
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenue over prior period revenue where current period revenue is translated using prior period exchange rates.
The following tables present the impact of foreign exchange effects on total revenue and Direct Revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:

2024
Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations in 2024 includes adjustments to earnings consisting primarily of $267.4 million of stock-based compensation expense; $87.5 million of depreciation; $74.2 million of impairments and amortization of intangibles; deferred income taxes of $15.0 million; and other adjustments of $2.0 million, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs of $6.5 million. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital primarily consists of a decrease in deferred revenue of $43.1 million as weekly subscriptions have increased and an increase in accounts receivable of $29.8 million primarily related to the timing of receipts and an increase in revenue from app stores. These decreases in cash were partially offset by an increase from other assets of $25.3 million, primarily related to amortization of certain assets, and an increase in income taxes payable of $22.2 million due to the timing of tax payments.
Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2024 consists primarily of capital expenditures of $50.6 million that are primarily related to internal development of software and purchases of computer hardware.
Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2024 is primarily due to purchases of treasury stock of $752.7 million and payments of $11.4 million of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards. These uses of cash were partially offset by $13.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock-based awards.
2023
Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations in 2023 includes adjustments to earnings consisting primarily of $232.1 million of stock-based compensation expense; $61.8 million of depreciation; $47.7 million of impairments and amortization of intangibles; deferred income taxes of $26.6 million; and other adjustments of $9.9 million, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs of $6.5 million. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in accounts receivable of $107.4 million primarily related to the timing of receipts and an increase in revenue from app stores, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $41.2 million as weekly subscriptions have increased. These decreases in cash were partially offset by an increase from other assets of $25.1 million.
Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2023 consists primarily of capital expenditures of $67.4 million that are primarily related to internal development of software and computer hardware to support our services.
Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2023 is primarily due to purchases of treasury stock of $546.2 million and payments of $5.9 million of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards. These uses of cash were partially offset by $19.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock-based awards.

Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations in 2022 includes adjustments to earnings consisting primarily of $366.3 million of impairments and amortization of intangibles; $203.9 million of stock-based compensation expense; $43.6 million of depreciation; and other adjustments of $7.0 million, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs of $6.7 million. Partially offsetting these 
adjustments was a deferred income tax benefit of $30.0 million. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital primarily consists of a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $472.6 million due mainly to the settlement payment for Rad, et al. v. IAC/InterActiveCorp, et al. and related arbitrations, and timing of other payments; an increase in accounts receivable of $6.7 million primarily related to increased revenue from mobile applications; and a decrease in deferred revenue of $6.5 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by an increase from other assets of $59.6 million primarily due to the amortization of prepaid hosting services.
Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2022 consists primarily of capital expenditures of $49.1 million that are primarily related to internal development of software and computer hardware to support our services, and cash used in an acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $25.7 million.
Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2022 is primarily due to purchases of treasury stock of $482.0 million, payments of $176.3 million to settle the outstanding 2022 Exchangeable Notes, payments of $109.3 million of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, purchases of non-controlling interests for $10.6 million, and payments of $7.5 million to settle outstanding warrants associated with the 2022 Exchangeable Notes. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of $75.9 million related to the settlement of certain note hedges associated with the 2022 Exchangeable Notes, and $20.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock-based awards.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash flows generated from operations. At December 31, 2024, $499.4 million was available under the Credit Facility.
The Company has various obligations related to long-term debt instruments and operating leases. For additional information on long-term debt, including maturity dates and interest rates, see “Note 7—Long-term Debt, net” to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For additional information on the operating leases, including a schedule of obligations by year, see “Note 13—Leases” to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The Company believes it has sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy these future obligations.
On January 21, 2025, the Company repaid the Term Loan in full utilizing cash on hand.
The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company expects that 2025 cash capital expenditures will be between $45 million and $50 million, flat to 2024 cash capital expenditures.
We have entered into various purchase commitments, primarily consisting of web hosting services that are currently committed through January 2028. Our obligations under these various purchase commitments, which were impacted by usage rates in 2024, are $68.6 million for 2025, $8.7 million for 2026, $9.8 million for 2027, and $9.0 million for 2028.
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2024, other than those described above.
In January 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate value of shares of Match Group stock (the “January Share Repurchase Program”). On December 10, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion in aggregate value of shares of Match Group common stock (the “December Share Repurchase Program”). The December Share Repurchase Program will take effect when the January Share Repurchase Program, of which $247 million in aggregate value of shares of Match Group common stock remains available as of December 31, 2024, is exhausted. Under both the January and December Share Repurchase Programs, shares of our common stock may be purchased on a discretionary basis from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Both the January and December Share Repurchase Programs may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024, we repurchased 22.2 million shares for $752.7 million under the January Share Repurchase Program.
Beginning mid-January 2025, the Company settles substantially all equity awards on a net basis. Assuming all equity awards outstanding on January 31, 2025 were net settled at the closing price on that date, we would issue 8.5 million shares of common stock (of which 0.6 million are related to vested awards and 7.9 million are related to unvested awards) and, assuming a 50% withholding rate, would remit $302.5 million in cash for withholding taxes (of which $20.7 million is related to vested awards and $281.8 million is related to unvested awards). If we did not settle awards on a net basis and instead issued a sufficient number of shares to cover the $302.5 million employee withholding tax obligation, 8.5 million additional shares would be issued by the Company.
At December 31, 2024, most of the Company’s international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences.
Our indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service, or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to pursue acquisitions or invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities. The Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of Match Group’s accounting policies contained in “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
Business Combinations
Acquisitions have historically been an important part of our growth strategy. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill is the Company’s largest asset with a carrying value of $2.3 billion at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, representing 52% of the Company’s total assets on both dates. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain of the Company’s acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $96.9 million and $183.1 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company assesses goodwill on its four reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying value.
Goodwill
When the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit’s goodwill is necessary; otherwise, a quantitative assessment is performed to further assess if any goodwill impairment exists.
If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
As a result of the change to our operating segments in the third quarter of 2024, we reassessed our reporting units and determined that the four operating segments are also our reporting units for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment. The Company re-allocated goodwill to each of the four reporting units based on their relative fair values as of September 30, 2024. This change in reporting units is considered a triggering event that requires a goodwill impairment assessment to be performed immediately before and after the change. There was no goodwill impairment identified in either the before or after impairment tests. In measuring the estimated fair value of each operating unit, the Company used a combination of an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed with assumptions and estimates of forecast operating cash flows, including revenue growth rates, profitability margins, and discount rates, which all vary among reporting units. The market approach utilizes the guideline public companies method and is based on revenue and earnings multiple data derived from publicly traded peer group companies.
The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their carrying values. The Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of October 1, 2024 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values. Additionally, the 2023 annual assessment did not identify any goodwill impairments.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values. The Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of October 1, 2024 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying values.
For assets in which a quantitative assessment is performed, the Company determines the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty discounted cash flow (“DCF”) valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the specific trade names and trademarks. The future cash flows are based on the Company’s most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company’s estimates are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed when a quantitative assessment is performed based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company’s 2023 quantitative assessments as part of the annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 15% to 18%, and the royalty rates used ranged from 3% to 8%.
If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded.
During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, in connection with our decision to terminate certain of our live streaming services and our Hakuna app, we recognized impairment charges of $28.7 million related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the Match Group Asia and Evergreen & Emerging segments. For certain assets with no remaining cash flows, the Company fully impaired the asset. For assets with remaining cash flows, the Company conducted discounted cash flow valuations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized impairment charges of $244.3 million in the Match Group Asia segment related to the Azar and Hakuna brands at Hyperconnect, $43.9 million in the Evergreen & Emerging segment related to the Meetic and Match brands in Europe, and $5.5 million in the Evergreen & Emerging segment related to certain Affinity brands in the U.S., all of which are included within “Impairment and amortization of intangibles” in the consolidated statement of operations.
At December 31, 2023, the aggregate indefinite-lived intangible asset balance for which the estimate of fair value was less than 110% of carrying values was approximately $76.5 million. These assets identified at December 31, 2023 had additional impairments taken during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the assets were either fully impaired as no additional cash flows were identified or impaired and moved to definite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, based on our qualitative analysis performed, none of the Company’s remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values were identified as being near their carrying value.
In connection with the annual impairment assessment, the Company reviews the useful lives for intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that an indefinite life may no longer be appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company reclassified certain indefinite-lived intangible assets with a carrying value of $47.2 million to the definite-lived intangible asset category because these assets were no longer considered to have an indefinite life.
Recoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Definite-lived Intangible Assets
We review the carrying value of all definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value 
of a definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. During the year ended December 31, 2024, in connection with our decision to terminate certain of our live streaming services and our Hakuna app, we recognized impairment charges of $1.9 million related to definite-lived intangible assets in the Match Group Asia and Evergreen & Emerging segments. The carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets was $118.5 million and $122.7 million, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Income Taxes
Match Group is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of asset and liabilities, as well as for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of enactment.
A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Such tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment. We make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the final outcome of these matters may vary significantly from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $267.4 million and $232.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Accounting for stock-based compensation at the Company is often complex due to the variety of instruments we use to attract, retain, and reward employees at many of our brands by allowing them to benefit from the value they help to create. We also utilize stock-based awards as part of our acquisition strategy. We accomplish these objectives, in part, by issuing awards denominated in the equity of our non-public subsidiaries as well as in Match Group, Inc. We further refine this approach by tailoring the terms of awards as appropriate. For example, we issue certain awards with vesting conditioned on the achievement of specified performance targets such as revenue or profits; these awards are referred to as performance awards. In other cases, we condition the vesting of awards to the achievement of value targets for a specific subsidiary or the Company’s stock price; these awards are referred to as market-based awards.
The Company issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”). The value of RSUs with vesting subject only to continued service is based on the fair value of Match Group common stock on the grant date. The value 
of RSUs that include a market condition is based on fair value estimated using a lattice model. The value of RSUs is expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting term. For PSU awards, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of Match Group common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
