I'll provide an overview of the Svelte app within the ui/src directory, including details about the svelte.d.ts and vite-env.d.ts files.

Let me first gather more information about the UI project structure to give you a complete overview.I'll examine the main files to give you a better understanding of the Svelte app structure.Let me explore more of the Svelte application structure to give you a comprehensive overview.Now that I've gathered some information about the Svelte app structure, let me provide you with an overview of the project.

## Svelte App Overview (ui/src)

The Svelte application in the src directory is a financial document viewer application called "Symbology" with the following structure:

### Core Files:
- **main.ts**: The entry point of the application that initializes the Svelte app by targeting the HTML element with id 'app'
- **App.svelte**: The main Svelte component that defines the application layout, consisting of a header and a dashboard with selectors and a viewer section
- **app.css**: Contains global CSS styles for the application
- **svelte.d.ts**: TypeScript declaration file for Svelte components
- **vite-env.d.ts**: TypeScript declaration file for Vite environment variables

### Key Directories:
- **components/**: Contains reusable Svelte components organized by feature
  - Company-related components (CompanySelector.svelte)
  - Filings-related components (FilingsSelector.svelte)
  - Document-related components (DocumentSelector.svelte, DocumentViewer.svelte)
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions and helpers for the application

### Type Declaration Files:

1. **svelte.d.ts**:
   This file provides TypeScript type definitions for Svelte components. It includes:
   - A module declaration for `.svelte` files
   - Type importing from Svelte's ComponentType
   - Ensures TypeScript understands and provides type checking for Svelte components

2. **vite-env.d.ts**:
   This file extends the Vite environment variable types with custom environment variables used by the application, including:
   - Database connection details (DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD, etc.)
   - API configuration (SYMBOLOGY_API_HOST, SYMBOLOGY_API_PORT)
   - Logging configurations (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_JSON_FORMAT)

### Application Structure:
The application follows a component-based architecture where:
- The main App component orchestrates the overall layout
- Specialized components handle specific features (company selection, filing selection, document selection and viewing)
- The UI appears to be responsive, with a layout that adapts between mobile (column layout) and desktop (row layout)

This Svelte application appears to be a financial document viewer that likely interfaces with the API defined in the api directory of your project. It allows users to select companies, browse their filings, and view specific documents, likely focused on financial data and analysis based on the overall project structure.
